i mean you have to really be her friend.
are you just asking a rhetorical question?
men pretend to love in order to have sex, women pretend to enjoy sex in order to get love.
i don't mean to be mean.
i would say an average of 45% but then once you get acquainted with the person, maybe 15%.
because some women send subtle messages to men rather than being clear.
let us buy coffee and converse and go from there!
also i hate it when my dad is unhappy.
ask him if u should go see a doctor.
you can post more rioins on yahoo!
he probably has so much to worry about right now other than you.
but i don't think he will be unfaithful or leave you due to lack of sex.
will i always feel that way?
but he might like all the waiting, dreaming and flirting.
and i would like to try again.
some guys shave...it depends on the woman.
well if you are really attracted to this guy, just smile and talk nice to him.
i'm not sure if he loves you but he definitely likes you.
i would take you on a date but i live inregon and i am totally uniform as to where you live.
women are co-ed.
i realize i'm too picky when it comes to people...how can i stop this?
and that does sound kinda girlish.
sometimes if the good outweighs the bad then the problems are worth it.
that is if both of you agree to do this.
one girl, michelle, who most likely wouldn't be mentioned, said she didn't believe in it.
well why do you like the one boy who picks on you?
and in addition, guys sometimes think they don't need you that bad until you're gone.
hey, if a guy inquires of you, don't be scared to say negative.
do i want to be in love?
that's the name i used... for what reason, though?
they'll think you're leering if you look at them creepily.
i think you're right, it's confusing.
how do i get my bf to show me he loves me.
that's if you really love them.
don't sell yourself, even if he's rich.
you sound like a very nice person so don't let these women make you feel bad.
i don't know, but i have a site on another site i visit..
i just want you to think how many super confident women exist.
without being in a relationship that might seem a little promiscuous.
he asked if i would like to use his chapstick.
you can say it but only if you mean it and also hold her hands and look into her eyes.
you should never let a guy mistreat you.
absolutely not, he's too big and i'm imirably weak.
you can tell him if he says yes.
what was the mistake that you took part in?
king has a song about this it's called 'only your mom loves you'
why are we in a relationship if our partner treats us badly after we fall in love?
if you have experienced it what was it like?
it's not a turn off if she drinks too much.
if that's what you want.
it's like getting rid of a drug habit.
wow i should do that next time i'm dating.
what is your want, though?
sounds like you both are comfortable with how things are right now.
don't let her control your life, she'll just have to learn to deal with it.
if he doesn't go out with you don't worry there are plenty of other options.
no man can give you everything you want.
if you want to stay married you need to find yourself.
start with a simple question and go from there.
inquire of their desire to travel to a place with you.
trust him and don't bring the matter up again.
i'm still trying to work up my nerves to try it out.
find the one that loves you too.
i'll be your significant other when you come to me town.
stay very far away from this guy.
its your choice not to like one i hate them all to say the least
i'd say about 3 or 4.
i don't know... would you like to have an item inserted in your rectum?
he's a womanizer and he's been telling that to some young girl.
i knew all my ex girlfriends were not the one until i met my wife.
don't try to have both of them at once, whatever you do.
sex is not the only thing important in life!
i have a yahoo e-mail address and that's enough for me.
for me fun includes eating meals...
but he was a little busy afterwards.
its just gonna be sexual intercourse.
don't approach her and let her know that you find her very attractive.
sounds like you're going through lots of stuff right now.
but you should ask a girl about the symptoms since i'm a boy.
i always felt the same way but my views changed when i met my true love!
men are stupid...what person understands the meaning behind their behavior?
your best friend is a good choice to marry if nothing else works out.
i don't want to walk up and ask, will you go out with me?
unless you know him pretty well, you're just putting yourself out there to get hurt.
you need to replace it, just add it back the same way you did the first time.
if its your personal belief in something its not good or bad.
they annoy you all day.
either go to hawaii or pay someone.
his or her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, good looks and how active they are are major factors in attraction.
i can just stop caring about him and forget about him like he meant nothing to me.
is it like a clear liquid that turns yellow when it dries?
it's a turn off if she sits on your best friend's lap when drunk.
well if it was prior to his relationship with you then obviously he wasn't unfaithful at all.
he had a controlling personality.
that's one of the gifts we can give ourselves.
you should get married only after you have been with a guy for at least 2 years.
hi and hugs to all my fellow girls at cone!
when you wither her just be yourself.
i have no idea what you're trying to say.
a guy asked if i would mind cuddling with him.
why would some guys do that?
a few good women are left you just have to look in the right places.
you should either move on or work it out with your partner.
get a hold of yourself how could you love a person that you dont even talk to?
find a pretty girl who is also pretty.
that doesn't mean you're promiscuious.
it's the only time in your life that you can live out true love!
you just have to find an answer yourself.
give them 2 months and they'll get over you.
after some time you won't see the color
he probably wants to know if you're interested in him.
if she's not interested in you anymore.
you're definitely not a promiscuous girl so don't worry.
no method exists for forcing a person to feel romantically towards you.
you should break up and keep yourself open to other options.
have you had a pap smear?
i can just say yes and mention i'm proud and have long black hair.
i have a friend in a similar situation.
i don't know, maybe you're young.
hi my name is gonna remain anonymous but i have been working together with this guy for years.
i don't get the question  would someone please give me the answer
if you really love him then you'll tell him.
if you're really attracted to her, go with your emotions.
think about if you can really afford it and if you want to then go on.
get your old life back so you can stay alive.
dude what you're saying is she doesn't.
don't use flirtatious language... such behavior isn't fun.
maybe some women would say it hurts a lot.
tell him of your real desires (that's the info, not an action)
if i were mad it would be easier to do.
you also should move on if they do.
you're being punished so you don't get to watch tv for a month.
tell him and it wouldn't seem crazy because you have to know one another for a while.
but that's her way...you can try it that way or you can stay watchful.
it seems so complicated... could you just explain it in simple terms?
give them a chance to see all your talents.
unless it's with the wrong guy.
my bf loves me so much and doesn't want to lose me.
if they're brunette or not that's all that matters.
after a while it has to be played out.
everyone, even if they don't admit it, likes to be told they are sexy.
i like to go dancing at clubs in downtown huston.
good luck but remember to do your homework.
i like natural appearance rather than a full face of makeup.
if you're interested in the guy then try it.
we're just getting divorced.
someone said women don't have feelings?
actions are better then words...
i've been thinking about a mid-level pink, but what should it be?
watch if he calls, sends e mail or even cares.
be sure to never ignore her, listen to her and don't change the subject.
he's my only source of income till i graduate from college.
she'll tell you if it's not ok.
i dont think i mind either way.
don't eat in the same place you defecate.
trying to get some blonde hair too.
don't worry about him, just focus on your classes and your boyfriend.
b: appearance really matters and anyone who claims otherwise is most likely lying.
i dont think i should have done that.
foreplay is important and should last at the bare mininum for 5 minutes.
what is a special gift i can give to my brother-in-law on his birthday?
try to be real and don't act ostentatiously.
good luck on your new adventure  i hope everything goes well!
if they don't then you have to go on with your life.
your first kiss... should be heavenly.
in a family life this is the most beautiful...
and most importantly, be real.
i know 3 guys i can do that with.
you should tell your parents you cant hide
this is
it's ok to jump on him if he's flirting with her.
stick with guys who are either 13 or 14.
tell him you just want to be friends and are disappointed by his stupid actions.
that's good it's like getting your dad's blessing.
unless you are very desperate wait for him to ask you out.
i really like this guy  i dont know if it is love or just infatuation.
if he does then it means sex is his only goal.
i've found that if i make a concerted effort i can see a reality that i know is not usually present.
i'd like to have some fun with you that's why i answered this stupid question.
do you feel that way?
give your brother some money and tell him he should leave.
maybe he'll call you.
something you can do is imagine your life with out him or her.
if you really want to keep company with her that much then you have to make it your top priority.
i pick the domestic goddess...
do you love her deeply?
men get bored before women do.
you can save money with flowers...
i would like to visit the united states of america  what would i need.
if you're not happy then you need to fix it or leave.
just because he has the potential to be a good guy doesn't mean he will be.
she may think it looks unattractive but in my opinion blue looks better.
u can make a citizen's arrest
having a big penis doesn't mean you're good in bed.
yeah it looks really pretty on almost any woman.
guys have issues with secrets.
yeah it all depends on the guy.
people asked me why was i rushing?
both of them don't respect your feelings.
even though i see him every week in psr i cant find the courage to talk to him.
i don't find a guy who behaves that way.
i'm attracted to guys who shave their legs.
is he gay or is it just curiosity?
in my opinion they do.
it's a wrong decision that can't be undone!
i lost my virginity in a park when i was 16.
they never met in person but she says they are in love.
ask him if he'd like to dance with you.
live life to the fullest and have faith.
i dont know if you fell down but i want to have sex.
he knows you like him so just ask him on a date.
repel your fear and tell him.
i wouldn't drive for 5 hours just to spend time with someone unless i really liked her a lot.
her friend to talk to her on the phone?
you should play sports with your friends.
and in
i cant picture my life without my husband.
we always push away the ones we love.
if you both feel the same way when you get older then go for it.
tell her, women like hearing the truth... best of luck to you.
you have to decide if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone with whom you constantly argue.
i use the term 'man' very lightly when talking about you.
personally i like a and b cups.
any girl looks sexy when standing beside an unattractive guy.
i would date someone 10 years younger who wants to date an older woman?
it's happened to me and now i'm dating said person.
just be honest about your feelings for her.
show her your naked baby pictures.
why do gay guys look to marriage?
we played coitus on the hood of my car in the light rain...
why should men grow up if women expect men to act like that?
you need to do this a few times to get comfortable.
while having sex is like a fantasy
at the moment i think he's mad, upset and unwilling to be with you.
if anyone knows the answer, just let me know.
red stands for love, black stands for death and so on.
i like someone with some weight because i feel cheated with a thin one.
if you dont know ask someone who has the answer.
his attempts to make it up to you will be fun.
the ones that pick on you usually like you.
ok i have been attracted to this girl since i was in 9th grade.
did you see her looking at you?
i never knew life could be so special.
all right i'm very, very into this one guy and i'm not gonna let go of his feelings in return.
what's best for the both of you?
at least she didn't give you a fake number.
so in my opinion you're not promiscuous.
but let them get married if they can't control themselves.
she calls him often.
why bother if you're already doing it?
many times you have loved a guy but weren't sure if he loved you back.
should i break up with him because of his mom?
make a nice move and if there is no responce she is not interested.
i have friends that get married after 6 months of dating.
be honest and ask after their life and you might get a response.
show your skills to her...
you'll look stupid.
that's a culture that does things right.
if you don't ask the question you'll always wonder about the answer.
tell me your opinion...thank you
i'd say not worry about it too much.
what's the worst thing that could happen?
i'm confused and don't know what to do because i hate for a girl to be that way.
you should find someone who doesn't hate you.
don't be rude.
that's not true most girls are just discreet.
some guys just have no interest in dancing.
this is not an intelligent generation...
you only have one child...are you married?
depends on if you were previously able to trust him.
unattractive and fat guys just accept what they can get.
people like to be husbands and wives for different reasons.
it's not worth it if all you do is argue.
have a good time in jail asking your cell mate that question.
are you asking if i like you?
what did you kiss?
girls have a curiousity about sex with other girls... myself included!
20 to 30 is fine and she doesn't have to be younger than you.
the concept is simple...  treat them honestly and with love.
when that happens your decision will be easier to make.
phrases to start a relationship are tawdry... be genuine and compliment her often.
he cheated, which i think means i can lift or carry my husband.
try to make the best out of a bad situation.
are you looking for friendship?
i think he'd make a great valentine.
this is hard due to the many temptations...
does it usually take a year to feel comfortable or bored in a relationship?
its all gonna depend on when you're ready.
of course i would love to meet women
it's just the way things are.
it's ok to be friends with someone online but there should be limits.
can you imagine starting a family with him?
should he refuse your request, his value is too low to start with.
to tell the truth you will learn but you have to experience things.
hopefully you married your husband because you love him.
well, it's in the girl's camp...what is it she likes?
i know i have someone who will be waiting when i get home.
get away from it all and go get a massage.
i dont know where to start.
that depends...are you an attractive person with an athletic form?
are you talking about your avatar?
you can try hanging out all day long and then you can top it off by giving him a foot massage.
if a guy cares about you then he'll call.
if your behavior is always like it is now... she might come to think you're in a state of desperation.
in my opinion there is a big difference between having sex and making love.
first of all i have 4 kids so i know being a homemaker is more work than my actual job is.
you don't have to stay together even if you have a kid.
are you a young woman from a rural environment or from an urban environment?
getting married and having kids can be postponed but your studies can't be.
i never went to it.
do you want to be in a relationship with the same guy?
how often can you have sex with pamela anderson?
u should make sure that getting your point across doesn't result in her hating u.
this just hits too close to home for me, my mom also has cancer.
i love to run my fingers through my hair.
i'm just talking about the two of you.
the right girl will come along if you're patient.
i want my wife to grow too.
he's obviously shy so maybe you should make a move.
and the doctor was surprised too.
should you have fun with the two of them, she'll most likely have sex with you.
where do you live?  i could come over and you could practice kissing me.
maybe you think it's a no but it's a no.
no offense...maybe because your name is freakgirl but if you were to show your face...maybe not.
men don't, just little boys.
maybe ask if they would like to go on a date sometime soon.
it happenned to me 2 times.
you shouldn't go out with a guy just because you feel the need to.
you wouldn't be asking if you really wanted to be with him.
and i just pray it never passes!
most women are waiting for a guy to tell her his true feelings.
women are more passionate during sex...
just try to impress her.
leaning towards me and kissing me gently on the forehead.
i'm not that type of person, but i know plenty of people like that.
she's only thinking about herself...no that should not happen on a first date.
ok, depends on how deep you are starting to feel for this boy!
in advance, thanks for the pep
why do they want to get married?
we like to be approached softly...with a little bit of chasing.
in any case i married my husband and i wonder if u know the reasons in addition to love
i'd like a trip to an amusement park or a museum.
i have feelings for a person and need to know if i am in love.
do you like fake nails or manicured nails?
first plan what you want and don't worry about what everyone else wants.
now we do all of these things together  i don't know what i should do.
i don't get you.
i asked him if he still liked me   he said he does but doesn't act that way.
i like the perfume you wear.
practice being able to unwrap starburst candies with your tongue... women love it.
i think most guys dont care but it does depend on the person.
it has nothing to do with being vulnerable, young or submissinve
don't get married so early in a relationship.
you are not a good person and you plan to be unfaithful to your wife.
be the best version of yourself and if he's impressed he'll talk to you.
you don't want to be with anyone but that person.
he's getting married and stop chasing it.
did you tell her the annoying nature of her daily check-ins with you?
when i moved in i was asked out by my neighbor.
most teenaged boys like teen girls like fornication.
he played a good game of basketball.
don't worry.
are you someone who likes arguing and fighting?
if his affections moved away from her and toward you, he probably would have given up the romance to be with you.
the most important thing is don't try to hit the person that wronged you.
one guy willing to move twenty-one hours and 14 hundred miles just to be with me.
have u seen a doctor yet?
maybe she's not a whore but the thin woman definitely was.
you should have an active life and not waste my time.
its like over-indulging in chocolate and then complaining because you've gained weight.
i went there and he was there.
if he's single go for it.
if you don't like guys like that they usually become the ones who beat their wives.
are you or are you not attracted to him?
if you're sure, then you should tell your parents if you haven't already done so.
many people will probably reject you.
do you think he has the same feelings for you?
some guys just say that word if they mean it.
it looks like he likes you and you should show him how u feel.
i'm of the opinion that everyone should keep their own name.
friends are forever because guys come and go.
try to imagine it was like love...
i think you should be ready even if your relationship survives 4 seasons.
all right, some guys like women of that type and others not so much.
if you want kids then be a homemaker.
younger guys and older women, good idea or not?
he wants to keep going.
you need to stay faithful to your husband...he is the one you made vows to.
so there is no alternative to the proper label of love.
also your self-esteem is very important.
i say those things and i'm female.
trust me girls can be just as perverted.
flowers are nice even if they don't last long.
there are movies i have yet to see.
she's a very sweet girl...just the person you're looking for!
try to use your brain and not your manhood...maybe she doesn't love you.
no disrespect intended... but it does sound like a lady's name.
i wouldn't take the trouble to call him back.
no women i'm attracted to in my list so i pick my neighbors.
marraige is about trust and communication.
don't listen to anyone else's advice.
what should i do to be happy with her?
give them a rose and express your love for them.
its weird, i agree, but it's not bad.
you need to see what's right for you both.
they are good enough for a guy but they aren't as good as us.
exactly, especially when she got sick.
due to...as you know...attempt to look for your loved ones...however, use caution!
i cant go any further without more info.
kissing is something you cant do wrong or right.
take time to decide...
just hanging out with guys is ok.
just think of the things you like and get the same in return... kinda like a massage with one's tongue.
my bf was definitely my friend...  that makes it complete euphoria.
i guess it's more of a trust issue.
i need someone to help me figure this out.
then move on if he still doesn't like you.
he probably isn't interested either.
try to make it yourself whenever possible.
can you do anything else besides work and fix things?
i told her i really loved her.
it seems that all of the senior girls think that freshmen girls are promiscuous, which is sad.
so how do i just kiss him?
if you check in the deleted stuff it should be there.
i hope you find a nice girl to date.
i dont think that is a good idea, you're not there for that purpose.
it's a very long list...
i would say back on the mountain you will be happy even if it is a guy.
if you don't base your relationship on sex then it's ok.
i'll most likely tell her soon because she's my best friend...in any case any help would be appreciated.
and also it is a portender of misfortune to see the betrothed at the marriage ceremony.
hold on and stay strong and good luck!
um, a little get-together for relatives.
if you're not sure about the performance part of it then don't do it.
i'm married now.
i think it's totally dependent on age and upbringing.
once you have kids you'll have to decide on a last name.
your kid will find it hard enough growing up without a dad.
bald guys look like kids to me and i don't find it sexy.
you should give it a chance  if you end up breaking up with that person it will be harder to be friends with them.
ask what the score of the last game was
if you are dating the guy you love you need to get rid of your ex.
the best and easiest way is to fly or drive to vegas and get married.
of course let me get to know you more.
i prefr a size c or d. any size bigger is a waste.
deceive and lie and then fabricate some more.
they haven't done that before and the pleasure is twice as good!
my wife doesn't like to wear those stuff.
we dont know what u look like.
because opposites attract and we always find a partner for life.
i think it's better than my personal life.
don't go anywhere with your new girl that you went with your ex.
talk to your best friend and see if it's ok.
it sounds weird but it worked for me in about 3 to 5 days.
i don't like it when he teases you about little things.
no, cos i'm not married yet.
a lot of guys like heavyset women, they are mostly african american.
i most enjoy expressing my feelings to women with poems...has anyone written one for their significant other?
i've previously expressed my love to her and she expressed her concern about hurting our relationship as friends.
if you like him then you shouldn't care and stay with him.
do they mock you when you're with him?
i love those guys since i'm a guy and i'm not required to invite a girl to the affair.
you shouldn't get married if you feel this strongly about it.
it's really dependent on whether or not a person is vain.
you need to move on and start a relationship with someone who doesn't hate you.
you should become acquainted with her and sooner or later one of you will ask the other out.
i asked him if he was blowing me off.
maybe some young guys like the younger asian girls.
make sure it's your decision.
tell him you want to keep it casual.
is he not treating you well? you should be happy.
this situation is a tough one with lots of problems.
they have been pretty good years, not always the easiest.
we have seen each other everyday for about 4 to 5 years.
imagine i'm the guy you want and then date me.
it never hurts anyone to flirt a little!
you should just stick with what you feel inside.
i wish u luck.
is it bad if i haven't kissed the girl i've been with for 8 months?
it's a woman's decision.
i think they look better than many other countries.
it would be ok the day after.
see if she's avaliable for dinner and a movie.
some guys don't think of their partner until they get to it.
just ask the question in english i cant understand you.
i'm sorry but i never felt that way.
remember no bird has ever tried to fly with one wing
i often think about this stuff.
you never find a significant other if you seem to be despondent.
i met agirl recently and i want to know if she likes me.
don't just sit around and wait for the phone to ring.
be quiet and be whatever sexual orientation you want.
many 22-year-old women are in relationships with 27-year-old men, so the 22-year-old guys feel insecure and
if he comes to his senses, great...if not, you should move on.
he may love you but he may want to disappoint his dad.
you'll just humiliate yourself if you apologize to him without making a mistake and don't get weak!
you should take action before it's too late.
this girl doesn't want a guy who deceives her.
i'd like to hear the perspective of an african american woman on this subject.
help me win this debate against her!
almost without exception (not always) those are men similar in age to you more or less.
when will pepole start to realize that?
i'm not sure what i should do.
you go to a bar and drink until you get inebriated.
i acted like that in the company of my current romantic partner.
if you have to ask then that's a negative.
don't sit there and wait till he realizes you are a good one.
even though i'm getting divorced i'm still stuck with this.
you'll be fine...just enjoy yourself.
your girl will just think you're being a jerk.
you cant fix the relationship with her parents, but you might be able to fix the relationship with her friends...why do you ask?
personally i would refrain from marrying any girl who wants to relinquish her name, but that is just my feeling.
maybe you should try to date young women, given the tendency by men to be mean.
i went out with my ex for 3 years and then he/she cheated.
you will know in time i recommend seeing what happens in 6 months
well the one i like goes something like this
not all guys break up with their girl.
going there is great fun and there are lots of things to do.
is it ok to kiss on the first date?
i have a girl friend that i'm close with.
they lust for each other.
when he does you should tell him that you want to be with him and it was a mistake to break up.
my friend tells me i'm too nice and i should tell him no.
but because there's always an exception, isn't there?
not all guys, but some guys do.
by doing so you're still able to keep your name.
approach her and say hello and ask if she's single.
that really excited me sexually but i ran away.
girls who are heavier can still be sexy.
not every one is going to college.
practice unwrapping starburst and tying cherry stems with your tongue.
if you keep talking to him for another week then he is gonna think he is married to you.
i'll pay if i can get your vote for the best answer.
you should look for somewhere in public where you will feel most comfortable.
flirt with him and see his reaction.
and it eases the pressure i feel to invite someone.
just say you'll go out with me.
she doesn't forget my mistakes.
how should i approach her without her thinking i'm just another guy with bad intentions?
as a guy i might have some insight.
don't worry you are only 13
always go trail riding with friends.
if the two of you really love each other then you'll work things out.
eye contact is the key...
i can lift him.
he just has to start over and regain your trust again.
i was with my ex boyfriend in 2nd grade and then in 4th grade and then again in 8th grade.
why u want to ask her out?
well i hope you'll read this info very thoroughly.
try playing 'truth or dare' together.
wait till you find out and confirm and go from there.
that's stupid because you need a theory class for that.
just quit if you do eat something like that.
i keep thinking about sex with her.
the only way you'll know is if you confront him and ask him directly.
jamie is gonna ask rubi out on a date.
the relationship is still going on because neither of you have the courage to end things.
it might be that it's fun for them to learn about that.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores 2 points.
do guys really like bigger women?
he loves you too, but only time can tell what will happen.
if a guy really respects you he'll understand you.
we have started our own sins...
his answer works for me...
you can still love him but you need to move on.
a girl that is smart is a turn-on.
i think it's wrong that they cant go out with her.
my sister closes her eyes to get ready when she kisses someone.
i met my last bf while i was driving in a roundabout.
he's, however, getting married this month.
should i just let it go and move on?
are you replaying everything that you did to me?
sounds like you guys are already married.
first of all why was the relationship not ended?
he can call you back if you give him space.
you should tell more people...
just go one step at a time and think how he lost something positive.
say hi harold, when will we be going out to dinner?
no not if you need to ask.
you need to go to school you can still come home or call your friends and family
i wish i could never again have sex.
allow him to approach you...if you do anything, you will seem obsessed with him.
some people don't do that because of their religion.
you should be very happy with yourself.
one does what feels comfortable to them  so no, i think it's a choice.
you have to think about that and that should help in deciding if or not he's trusty!
i didn't mean to ask 'do you think women are sexy and beautiful?'
ask if they're gonna get violent.
sounds like you like selling yourself too much.
see if the guy you like is willing to go out of his way for you.
but it's not defined as you both being unable to have affection for one another.
if they dont know anythign about you how would they know?
what do other people's opinions matter?
if you could have 4 qualities in your girl what would they be?
women like it when guys are nice.
i feel silly, weird, and exuberant.
just keep it cool...it might be a little hard to get!
see the way she walks...
he shouldn't care if you're at a dance together.
women are attracted to confident guys.
ask her for another date...
u should make an appointment with a therapist!
i still feel all-consuming romantic love for him.
but that's ok i'm generous if you understand my point.
go ahead and get something that you cant get rid of.
you only met guys with a specific taste.
but i'm not telling you that you have to be celibate till then.
don't force him to dance if he doesn't want to.
i'm a guy and i'll tell you what i know.
my girl won't tell me she loves me to my face.
we cant know if she's sincere.
can u help me get to know her?
i have long black hair and both my husband and i are pretty fond of it.
people just make their decisions fast.
maybe they're trying to be something they're not?
no you won't my friend i was married to someone totally inconsiderate
you need to stay away from your guy friend.
i'm looking for a girl who wants to spend time with me.
and for me at least it was the best thing.
i first met a guy one time, romance galore...we first met in this incredible rainstorm.
you'll get more if you're willing to work more.
i wonder if it could ever be the same after that.
it could be you just have to pick one and know why you picked that one.
wait another 4 years...
i'm happy i have brown hair.
if you want a gift for your husband i would suggest sports stuff or car stuff.
that's not what you can become.
the problem is that he did the worst thing he could have done by cheating on me recently.
use your imagination to picture yourself with him at night.
it hurt a lot and i started to bleed.
it could mean so many things...
10 yrs of separation is just so appealing.
you need to do more then make eye contact.
do you want all your friends to stay with you forever?
i hate him for the way he acted.
i know, however, what i want in a relationship.
it happened in the river while people were watching...it was funny!
if you're also very pretty you should show him your boobs.
so it's natural for that guy.
i get happy when i see an ad for malaysia on tv.
go out and try everything you couldn't do when you were in a relationship.
it's very possible to enjoy giving pleasure more than you enjoy receiving it.
is it normal to still have feelings for him after 6 months?
if you start to feel it coming on then start the foreplay.
guys will want you to be attractive no matter what, usually.
it's a challange...
just ask a girl walking by and they are everywhere in thailand.
its very important to last between 30 and forty-five minutes.
my concern is that i'm deeply attracted to him.
it's because it's buy one, take one
i didn't realize pakistan is that conservative.
we can play together and be best friends.
i rarely see him in school but i have seen him at my brother's basketball games.
you didn't give us very useful info...where do all of you live?
you need to admit why you're attracted to her.
it's another way to say they don't like you.
everyone has to break up at some point.
i worked there for a while and met a guy i love.
i'll most likely just go and see.
and for what reason...just to accomplish your intent.
woman, more men exist in the world with a fondness for overweight women, contrary to your beliefs.
i didn't think he would remember, it was casual when i said it.
girls to not guys that are self absorbed.
you have to look...
either a cd or dvd will be ok.
you two have toil rigorously to get that!
should she express any interest, she'll call at a future time.
i really care about you and can't stop thinking about you when we are apart.
should i give him another chance at some point in time?
if it feels like your love is fading, don't ignore it.
daniel never read a manga book.
if they actually apply, try using some of these.
same thing happened to me too.
or that she just wants to go out with other people?
pick the one you like the most.
be ready to let her go.
i sometimes reveal details about my problems too early in a relationship and maybe i told that guy too much.
i guess it's common but i'd just go on.
dump him, it would be better.
sometimes you just have to watch your significant other.
you get the popcorn if he gets them first.
what does it matter if it's a relationship for you both?
my girl is the zealous person i know and i love her more for it.
one day you'll find a guy who really deserves you.
be strong and don't lose hope.
instead, how about blue and green?
some men do and some don't.
i want a girl who is kind, and intelligent.
it's not as bad as it could have been...at least it's not bella.
its more like 65% or 70% and not 90%.
what good did it do?
i dont know what it is that she wants.
my eternally close friend hates my partner and hopes for the end of our relationship but that wont happen.
we were just spending a little bit of time together.
you still got a thousand at least.
all my friends want to do is engage in heavy kissing.
happy birthday to you...
since females experience thought through their brain activity.
in my opinion u should compliment her, ask her name, act normal and act normal.
how much time must go before you can decide it takes too much time and she has no real interest?
girls don't think it is cool  they think that men who smoke are bad because they are killing themselves.
i only hang out with guys i'm not attracted to, i'm sure you know the outcome.
the timing with the older guy wasn't right, you'll see.
bring both of them out on a date.
i am my sister's maid-of-honor and i want it to be perfect.
i have the worst time sleeping because my bf snores!
if they dont get along then they shouldn't spend time together.  why does it matter what they think?
don't let her know that you want to be with her forever and you probably stand a better chance of that being the way it is.
tell her to just call you about important stuff.
i have to stop right now because i'm ready to relieve myself.
for me i could start to forget about you once 3 days have passed.
or is it just that you want to say that?
before anyone gets hurt i agree with the other person
people don't like being played with like they were a yo-yo.
i'd like that being done to me.
you can impress her with love and affection...
men have penis and women have clitoris.
by this time you should love your wife for everything the two of you have done.
i don't need a high maintenance girl i want a friend
i hate it personally i like the one that's straight
if she's fond of him...a motivation exists.
there's no one you can trust more than a good friend.
that is weird but i don't know i will talk to my friend next to his locker.
if you're average, boobs don't really matter.
i'm a guy so i also have feelings.
try to contact their question and answer team and they will help you with the process and enjoy your day!
i like intelligent, fun, and captivating women.
well that girl answered the first question for me.
if the photo is a salacious photo they would like to have sex.
where u been meeting these girls from the philippines
maybe you should ask him out to lunch, movie or something like that.
i don't because i like guys that look normal.
i had someone get really bad with me because i kept dating.
i love him but i'm also ready to move on.
yes, ask for permission and watch how fast she gets violent with you.
men think they are special and that only certain women are good enough for them.
i just want sex here and there.
i've heard that so many times.
sounds like you're the alpha in the relationship.
wait for the one that will love you for you.
don't go to the place, it looks suspicious.
it's all about the looks.
its time to forget about him, if you two are meant to be he will come back to you.
the guy i'm attracted to is angry with me.
do you like asian food?
my cousin met up with an crazy deviant that she met online and he told her that he was a slut.
should a question be asked the message is that i haven't fallen in love.
don't even listen to what any person says...just watch the way they act.
keep your personality and don't let any man decide how you act.
i love him still, what should i do?
just talk about the subject with your spouse.
if you just roll your eyes at him the challenge is non existent.
another option is that you could tell her and have a fairy tale romance.
you are killing the love by asking that inane question...or have you considered partaking in fun activities as a couple?
plus, engage in kissing and inquiring as to your kissing abilities.
jules sac is funny but he's mean too.
do u see my partner?
from my point of view when a guy is very self-centered i find that makes him far less appealing.
i know this because i have a similar personality to your wife.
i dont think you are ready if you have to ask other people.
take your shirt off and yell like Tarzan does.
if you don't love your husband any longer then move on and make room for another guy.
make it an honest compliment about her.
i'm interested in a boy in 6th grade too!
they feel insecure around less educated guys.
maybe we can go on a date and we'll find love with eachother.
if she tells the reinstation i will be expelled because it is pakistan and not america.
my friend is in a relationship with someone online.
i like the feeling of cuddling with a big girl.
i think the bomb is so much easier!
i met ______'s (insert name) dad on his side of the family.
anything that can't be easily moved.
start a friendship first and then let the relationship develop.
i was cheated on 3 of the 4 years i was in a relationship.
attack him because he's interested in someone else?
don't let them know in advance but just let them know once you are in bed.
it's not so important here in america.
be confident and always believe in yourself...don't become arrogant...just make eye-contact and listen to what she has to say.
just let it take its course.
i know because i date someone like that.
my wish is that i had paid attention to the comments in my circle.
leave him if he misbehaves.
do whatever makes you happy!
we tried to move on but it didn't work out.
if you're not confident enough to ask, someone else might ask.
my twin wont talk or listen to me.
she'll answer the question because most girls are polite.
you married him for a reason.
ask him if he'd like to go to the movies with you.
some women can't seem to find guys their own age that are sexy.
it didnt matter as we are just friends.
in such a case... enroll in some self-defense courses.
it just seemed like that to me anyway.
how inebriated is this girl going to get?
you should take the time to get acquainted with both of them without dating either of them.
he loves you and you're aware of that?
you can join a community that has live and webcam chat.
i gotta tell you, those were good times.
if you're promiscuous then he is too.
caucasian women are imitating all the men!
i'd be crazy if she called me 5 times a day.
you might be the only one with whom he can have sex.
inform the miscreant of his need to vacate
wow, how old are you?
they think they can control the lives of others when they can't.
you'd just let him go if you like him.
a person i can act naturally with.
the rest is simple from this point on!
tell them i love u...it will tell you everything...if they wait to say it back.
i just broke up a 3-year relationship with the father of my baby.
good luck in your search for your perfect match...
even though time has passed i still love him.
he already knows you care for him and has he said anything about it?
everyone has their own perferances on who they find attractive.
my wife is a nice woman.
what will happen if you ask him to be casual lovers?
i like him and he says he would date me if i was single.
women can be worse then men.
she might be trying to use you.
just abstain from doing things that might be harmful to you.
you'd be very surprised to see the type of people that are attracted to him.
delay doing so till you get to age 25 your appeal wont diminish in such a time.
so that's the way to go if you're set on that.
do guys know what they want in a relationship?
if you need to break up emotionally then you are gonna have some problems.
but if you get used to it and enjoy it somewhat, go along with it.
remember the vow is till death do you part!
there's nothing wrong with her asking for your phone number.
if the answer is yes then why do i hear so many girls saying flowers don't last?
don't be shallow and start with her looks.
asking her that question shouldn't bother her if you two are in a serious relationship.
i'd pick maui or bahamas.
the problem is if you are going to ask her out while at work or not.
the way he asked me out was very ingratiating
you just set up a double standard.
i can't offer a wife-based opinion, but i'm hoping my opinion is equally valuable.
you are justified in feeling disappointed and angry...
when he got to his station he left the train.
start from the beginning and then work your way to 20 years down the road.
don't be afraid to say no.
i don't care what she says, leave it alone, she's in enough pain.
for one thing there goes your job if it doesn't work out.
u could try dancing at a club...
many times i have missed out on a great opportunity by thinking about someone else.
how can i get him to stop pestering me?
when you are 18-20... sometimes you say what you don't mean.
i wonder why he shaved his legs.
you should be nice, make eye contact and smile
what does everyone think?
this question is for the guys... (a) what size girl do you like?
she doesn't want you to like her just for her good looks.
good luck that's all i can say!
there was one time i told a girl i loved her and meant it.
if she says yes then go pick them up.
if you want her to be your friend, it's probably that you want a deeper relationship.
you'll hurt your loved ones if you keep secrets.
be real and show some machismo that is what women, or at least most women, like.
don't worry about what others say.
any guy that says he would is more than likely not being entirely honest with himself.
forget him and date his brother.
death is like a box full of candy corn  it gives you cavities
i wouldn't want a pair that big.
i like to believe that because of the way society dictates it i think we should rebel against society and appreciate curvier women.
that just makes her easier to have sex with.
call him if u feel that level of attraction to him.
it's because you dont have any power over the decision.
its your own life make your own decisions
as one gets older... keep getting younger and younger men to make you feel better.
by the way i'm not the kind of girl who likes a romantic dinner at home.
i'm just doing this so i'll get points.
that's a risk you're gonna have to take.
work on your relationship but don't let him keep you locked up at home.
no matter what you decide to do, don't tell him too soon.
it's not wise to date work colleagues.
if going to the movies is fun for you as a couple, take part in that activity.
it takes place prior to 3play and before 5play.
buy a toy for sex that you both would like.
egotism is a man's thing, you just have to live with it.
i agree with udaman
i like him very much but i want to convince him not to reject him.
i dont think about him but i have dreams with him in them.
probably not until he finds another girl.
you need to date some new people.
you shouldn't do anythign that you'll regret later.
one of the best rules of internet dating is to chat via email and phone.
yeah i did it and it was a blast.
there are lots of cheap ideas... find what you're interested in and work from there.
you might be looking for a class of guys that think the world of you.
you'll find mrs. right?
you know you were meant to be together if you can break the wind in front of each other.
i hope i see some of it very soon.
just approach her and start a conversation.
well i have no knowledge of your age which would be of great help.
i think it's an unhealthy behavior.
we have no room in our society for crazy monsters like that.
did you mean it sounds more sexy?
is that a bad question?
its like saying, what can stop me after i've already done it?
choosing the right date can save you so much money.
that's all i got to say about that.
why is it so hard for guys to say the word love?
and if she loves you, your girl should accept that.
then he asked me if i could go with you.
a decent amount of guys just want sex.
usually it's caused by a spasm in the back.
they should try taking our last names...
you are gonna lose your friend over a guy.
you'll know if he's attracted to you!
i love that they like challange
give her a tape or cd.
i want to be happy.
don't try to experience sex.
on occasion i'm in a relationship with someone and i suffer embarrassment.
when you're ready it's worth the wait.
you are too precious for those people.
does that mean he's attracted to me?
i think the guy should take the first step in a relationship.
if i could i would have kept my last name
you need to seperate the bad thing and move on.
ask him how he is once in a while.
go out and try new things in order to meet people.
i still have feelings for my ex and i'm mad with my cousin due to my ex liking her.
it was a good idea after all.
celebrate valentine's day with happiness, gift-giving, and fun.
not for anything other than appearance.
they never had a chance.
but i think they both have feelings for me.
they like tiny women.
don't forget to pick and vote for the best answer.
i have been with my husband for 4 years and we just recently got married in december of 2005.
the pier and the museums are great to visit... there are also so many great restaurants and hotels.
often one of them will cheat on the other.
don't worry i don't have that many options myself.
my mom books trips at www.alanatvl.com
the time has been more than 6 months and it seems i can't move on.
she need to move to Mass.
it really doesn't matter but i'm fine with a handful.
some women like non-perishable gifts that are long-lasting.
she is strong, loving and not as happy as she thought.
you are young if you are interested in 6th graders
size, shape, looks and other surface features shouldn't matter at all.
you are asking what their stance is on gay relationships?
i say kiss him and he'll have a response for you.
he gave me his phone so i could put my number in it.
if you want to enjoy your time, try checking out some night clubs, bars, or gyms.
so i would say that they do but not often i hope that is helpful.
if you're in florida look me up
ask her on a date.
i'm sorry but i don't know i wish the both of you luck.
hey i'm interested in visiting your country.
search for another hot girl to make her jealous.
dont ask that question if you dont want to get upset.
she knows how much i care about him so i dont know what to do.
and lastly does he always happen to be staring?
you should try foreplay...it slows the pace.
fair skinned women have a tendency to look paler when their hair is black.
i wasn't gonna let her come in first.
never tell her she's fat.
want to hear a bad joke?
you know how it would be if you didn't play...the guilt trip.
it looks like he's enjoying his self too much while you're away.
absolutely i dont think anyone would.
some couples are never gonna be that comfortable with each other.
it's obvious that guys aren't much better.
i never went on a second date with him.
maybe because you are the most attractive young girl they have ever met.
you have found your true love and you need to be with them.
you dont need to prove anything if the guy is good enough.
you're too young to already talk about kissing.
order one online and then a magical stork will bring one to you.
it gets harder as time goes on.
just go on with your life and find an alternative person!
how old are they?
all you have to do now is smile.
the bottom line is you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking of him.
the girls that complain about the short life of flowers are just unappreciative.
i laugh because that's why i'm single.
the women that are pretty and have a great personality.
i don't like girls.
you should refuse to see your cousin and your bf.
i dont remember ever giving a girl a christmas gift unless i cared for her.
who is able to determine if rural women feel more sexually attractive?
i met mine at a carnival.
my husband likes my personality...
she's not a false witness.
should they fail to do so the moment has arrived to continue apace.
decide what kind of arrangements and flowers you would like.
in the event he has no objection, what if the other person has a different perspective?
you're most likely too good for him.
she lets me work on my trucks and watch cartoons.
lime green is more like a summer wedding color.
is there anything i can do about it?
the right relationship just happened on its own.
appearance is not important unless you are trying to prove something.
just be honest i can handle the truth.
you could start the day by eating breakfast and then take a nice walk.
i did this before and my friend was mad that i deleted him.
don't have sex.
be nice when you tell her.
the two of you should kiss when you're ready.
ask her questions (not just conversing)
i think you're a good guy...most likely she loves you a lot.
when she calls... reply with a text message.
no, it's totally not, you're just wasting your health because women just hate it.
you need to find someone you like and ask them to be your valentine.
you should tell her that you miss and love her.
should no action prevail you have to ask it of him once more.
some don't have it in them but some do.
he will most certainly not back off your request.
that's a nice picture of george clooney.
my friend wants me to change my look.
those replies are arrogant, i'm so much more attractive.
bad teeth, bad breath, and disgusting body odor.
no words will make the situation better...
the world would be happier if men knew what women want.
do you want to have oral sex with another guy?
i'd rather you don't marry.
yeah i'm a guy so i dont really have to pay.
if he wants to wear my pants he just has to ask.
