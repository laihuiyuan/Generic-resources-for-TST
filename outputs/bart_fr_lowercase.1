i mean you gotta really be her friend...
are you just asking a rhetorical question...
men pretend to love in order to have sex, women pretend to enjoy sex in order to get love.
i don't mean to be mean...
i would say an average of 45%......but then, once you get acquainted with the person, maybe 15%.
because some women send subtle messages to men... rather than being clear...
let us get coffee and converse and go from there!
also, i hate it when my dad is unhappy.
ask him if u should go see a doctor...
u can post more questioins on yahoo!
he probably has so much to worry about right now......other than you.
but i don't think he will be unfaithful or leave you due to lack of sex.
will i always feel that way...
but he may not like all the waiting, dreaming and flirting.
also, i'd like to try again...
some guys shave... it depends on the woman...
well if you really like this guy, just smile and talk nice to him.
i'm not sure if he likes you, but he sure likes you.
i would take you out on a date but i live in oregon and i'm totally uniform as to where you live.
women are cooped up...
i realize i'm too picky when it comes to people...how can i stop this?
well that kinda sounds kinda feminine...
sometimes......if the good outweighs the bad......then the problems are worth it.
that's if both of you agree to do this...
one girl, michelle, who most likely wouldn't be mentioned, said she didn't believe in it.
well why do u like the one boy who picks on you?
in addition, guys sometimes think they don't need you that bad till you are gone.
hey, if a guy asks of you, don't be scared to state it.
do i wanna be in love?
that's the name i used for it...for what reason, though?
they'll think you're leering if you look at them creepily.
i think you're right, its kinda confusing...
how do i get my bf to show me he loves me...
that's if u really like them...
don't sell yourself...even if he's rich...
you sound like a very nice person, so don't let these women make you feel bad.
i don't know, but i have knowledge of another webpage that i visit..
i just want u to consider......how many overly confident women exist.
without being in a relationship, it might seem a little promiscuous...
he asked if i wanted to use his chapstick...
you can say it...but only if you mean it...and hold her hands and look into her eyes.
u should never allow a guy to mistreat u...
no, he's too heavy and i'm imirably weak.
u can tell him if he says yes...
what was the mistake that you took part in...
king has a song about this...it's called...only your mom loves you.
why are we in a relationship if our partner treats us badly after we fall in love?
if you've done it...what was it like?
its not a turn off if she drinks too much...
if that's what you want...
its like getting rid of a drug habit...
wow, i need to do that the next time i'm dating.
what...what is your want, anyway?
sounds like you both kinda like how things are right now.
don't let her control your life, she'll just have to learn to deal with it.
if he doesn't go out with you, don't worry, there are plenty of other options.
no man can give you everything you want...
if you wanna stay married, you gotta find yourself.
start with a simple question......and go from there.
talk about their desire to travel to a place......with you.
trust him...and don't bring the matter up again.
i'm still trying to work up my nerves to try it out...
find the one who loves you too...
i'm gonna be your significant other if u come to me town.
stay very far away from this guy...
its your choice not to like one, i hate them all to say the least.
i'd say about 3 or 4...
i don't know... would you like to have an item inserted in your rectum?
he's a womanizer and he's been telling that to some young woman.
i knew all my ex girlfriends were not the one till i met my wife.
don't try to have both of them at once, whatever you do...
sex isn't the only thing important in life...
i got a yahoo e-mail address and that's enough for me.
for me... fun includes eating meals...
but he got a little busy afterwards.
its gonna just be sexual intercourse...
don't approach her and let her know that u find her very attractive.
sounds like u going through lots of things right now.
but you need to ask a girl about the symptoms since i'm a boy.
i always felt the same way, but my views changed when i met my true love!
men are stupid...what person understands the meaning behind their behavior?
your best friend is a good choice to marry if nothing else works out.
i don't want to walk up suddenly and ask, will u go out with me?
unless you know him pretty well, you are stinking out there to get hurt.
you need to replace it, just put it back in the same way you did the first time.
if its your personal belief in something its not good or bad...
they annoy you all day long...
either go to hawaii or pay someone...
his or her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, good looks, and how active they are......are major factors in attraction.
i can just stop caring about him and forget about him like he meant nothing to me.
is it like a clear liquid that turns yellow when it dries...
its a turn off if she sits on your best friend's lap when drunk.
well, if it was prior to his relationship with you, then obviously he wasn't unfaithful at all.
he had a controlling personality...
determination...its one of the gifts we can give ourselves...
you should get married only after you have been with a guy for at least 2 years.
hi and good luck to all my fellow girls at cone!
when u wither her, just be yourself...
i dont know what you're trying to say...
a guy asked if i would mind cuddling with him.
why would some guys do that...
a few good women are left......you just have to look in the right places.
you should either move on......or work it out with your partner.
get a hold of yourself... how could you love a person that you dont even talk to?
find a talented girl...who is also pretty...
that doesn't mean u are promiscuious...
its the only time in your life......that you can live out true love!
u gonna have to find an answer yourself.
give them 2 months and they'll get over you.
after some time......you won't see the color.
he probably wants to know if u're interested in him...
if she's not interested in you...
you're definitely not a promiscuous woman, so dont worry.
no method exists......for forcing a person to feel romantically towards you.
you should break up...and keep yourself open to other options...
have u had a pap smear?
i can just say yes and say i'm proud and have long black hair.
i have a friend in a similar situation...
i don't know...maybe you're young...
hi my name is going to remain anonymous but i've been working with this person for years.
i dont understand the question...  would someone please give me the answer...
if you really love him then you'll tell him.
if you're really attracted to her, go with your emotions...
think about if you can really afford it and if you want to, then go ahead.
get your old life back so you can stay alive...
dude, what you're saying is she doesn't
don't use flirtatious dialogue... that kind of thing isn't appealing.
maybe some women would say it hurts a lot...
advise him of your real desires (that's the info relayed, but an action not attempted)
if i were mad it would be easier to do...
u also should move on if they do...
you're being punished so you don't get to watch tv for a month.
tell him and it wouldn't seem psychotic because you gotta get to know one another for awhile.
but that's her way...you could try it that way...or you could stay watchful.
its kinda complicated... could u just explain it in simple terms?
give them a chance to see all your talents...
unless it's with the wrong guy...
my boyfriend loves me very much and doesn't want to lose me.
if they're brunette... thats what matters.
after a while it has to be played out...
everyone, even if they don't admit it, likes to be told they are sexy.
i like to go dancing at clubs in downtown huston...
good luck...but remember to do your homework...
i like natural looks... rather than a full face of makeup...
if you're interested in the guy, then try it.
we are now just divorced...
someone said women don't have feelings...
actions are better then words...
i've been thinking about a mid-level pink hue, but what should it be?
watch if he calls, sends an e mail or even cares.
be sure to never ignore her, listen to her, dont change the subject.
he's my only source of income till i get out of college.
she'll tell you if its not ok...
i don't think i mind either way.
don't urinate in the same place you defecate.
trying to get some blonde hair as well...
don't worry about him, just focus on your classes, and your boyfriend.
option b: appearance really matters and anyone who claims otherwise is most likely being lied to.
i dont think i should have done that...
foreplay is important and should last......at the bare mininum, 5 minutes.
what's a special gift i can give to my brother-in-law on his birthday?
try to be authentic and dont act ostentatiously...
good luck on your new adventure...i hope everything goes well!
if they don't, then you'll have to go on with your life.
your first kiss... should be heavenly...
in a family life... this is the most beautiful...
most importantly... be real...
i know 3 guys i can do that with...
you should tell your parents...you can't hide...
it's     i love and adore plus-size women!
its ok to jump on him if he's flirting with her.
stick with guys who are either 13 or 14...
tell him you just want to be friends and are disappointed by his stupid actions.
its good, its like getting your dad's blessing.
unless you are really desperate wait for him to ask you out...
i really like this guy,  i dont know if its love or just infatuation.
if he does......then it means sex is his only goal.
i've found if i put in a lot of effort......i can see a reality that i'm not usually in.
i'd like to have some fun with you, thats why i answered this ridiculous question.
do u feel that way?
give your brother some money and tell him he needs to leave...
maybe he'll call u...
something you can do is imagine your life with out him or her.
if you really wanna keep in touch with her that much, then you gotta make it your top priority.
i pick the domestic goddess...
do u love her so much...
men get bored before women do...
u can save money with flowers...
i would like to visit the united states of america  what would i need.
if you're not happy then you need to fix it or leave.
just because he has the potential to be a good boyfriend doesn't mean he will be.
she may think it looks unattractive  in my opinion blue looks better.
u can do a citizen's arrest...
having a big penis doesn't mean u are good in bed...
yeah, it looks really pretty on almost any woman...
guys have issues with secrets...
yeah... it depends on the guy.
people had asked me...why was i rushing?
both of them dont respect your feelings...
even though i see him every week in psr i can't find the courage to talk to him.
i dont find a guy that behaves that way often.
im attracted to guys who shave their legs...
is he gay or is it just curiosity??
in my opinion...they do...
its a bad decision that can't be undone...
i lost my virginity in a park when i was 16...
they have never met in person but she says they are in love.
ask him if he'd like to dance with u...
live life to the fullest...and have faith...
i dont know if you fell down but i wanna have sex.
he knows you like him so just ask him out on a date.
soel your fear and tell him...
i wouldn't drive 5 hours just to spend time with someone unless i really liked her a lot.
her friend to talk with her on the phone...
u should play sports with your guys...
in iniitiating romantic love......you feel elated, delighted, and happy......just urinating on that person.
i cant picture my life without my husband...
we always push away the ones we love...
if you both feel the same way when you get older, then go for it.
tell her, women like hearing the truth... best of luck to you...
you gotta decide if you wanna spend the rest of your life with someone with whom you constantly argue.
i use the word 'man' very lightly when talking about you...
personally, i like a and b cups.
any woman looks sexy......when standing beside an unattractive man.
i'd like to date someone 10 years younger...who wants to date an older woman?
it's happened to me and now i'm dating said person.
just be honest about your feelings for her...
show her your nude baby pictures...
why do gay guys look to marriage?
we played coitus on the hood of my car in the light rain...
why should men grow up if women expect men to act like that?
you gotta do this a few times to get comfortable...
having sex is kinda like a fantasy...
at the moment i think he's mad, upset and not willing to be with you.
if anyone knows the answer...please let me know...
red for love, black for death...and so on...
i like someone with some weight because i feel cheated with a thin one.
if you dont know... ask someone who has the answer...
his attempts to make it up to you will be fun...
the one that pick on you usually likes you...
ok, i've been attracted to this girl since i was in 9th grade.
did u ever see her looking at you?
i never knew life could be so special...
all right, i'm very, very into this one guy and i'm not gonna let go of his feelings in return.
what's best for the both of you...
at least she didn't give you a fake number...
so......in my opinion......you are not promiscuous.
but let them get married if they can't control themselves.
she calls him all the time...
why bother if you're already doing it?
many times you have loved a guy but weren't sure if he loved you back.
should i break up with him because of his mom?
make a nice move and if there is no responce, she's not interested.
i have friends that get married after 6 months of dating...
be honest... ask for their life and you might get a reply...
show your skills to her...
you're gonna look silly...
its a culture that does things right...
if you don't ask the question......you'll always wonder about the answer.
tell me your opinion... thanks...
i'd say don't worry about it too much.
what's the worst thing that could happen...
i'm confused and dont know what to do because i hate for the girl to be that way.
u should find someone who doesn't hate u...
don't be rude...
its not true... most girls are just discreet...
some guys just have no interest in dancing...
its not an intelligent generation...
you have one kid...  are you married?
depends on if u were ever able to trust him...
unattractive and overweight guys just accept what they can get.
people like to be husbands and wives for different reasons...
its not worth it if all you wanna do is argue.
have a good time in jail... ask your cell mate that question...
are you asking if i like you?
so...what did you kiss?
girls have a curiousity about sex with other girls... myself included!
20 to 30 is fine and she doesn't have to be younger than you.
the concept is simple...  treat them honestly and with love.
when that happens......your decision will be easier to make.
phrases to start a romance are tawdry, be genuine and compliment her often.
he cheated, which i guess means i can lift or carry my husband.
try to make the best out of a bad situation...
u looking for friendship...
i think he'd make a great valentine...
its hard due to the many temptations...
does it usually take a year to feel comfortable or bored in a relationship?
its gonna all depend on when u are ready...
of course i'd love to meet women...
its just the way things are...
its ok to be friends with someone online...but there should be limits.
can u imagine starting a family with him...
should he refuse your request......his value is too low to start with.
to tell the truth......you will learn......but you have to experience things.
hopefully...you married your husband because you love him.
well its in the girl's camp...what is it she likes?
i know i have someone who is gonna be waiting when i get home.
get away from it all and go get a massage...
i dont know where to start...
depends... are u an attractive person with an athletic form?
u mean your avatar?
u can just hang out all day long together and then u can top it off by giving him a foot massage.
if a guy cares about you, then he'll call.
if your behavior is always the way it is now......she may come to believe you are in a state of desperation.
in my opinion......there is a big difference......between having sex and making love.
first of all i have 4 kids so i know being a homemaker is more work than my real job is.
you don't have to stay together...even if you have a kid.
are u a young woman from a rural environment or from an urban environment?
getting married and having kids can be postponed......but your studies can't be.
i've never been to it...
do u wanna be in a relationship with the same guy?
how often can u have sexual relations with pamela anderson?
u should make sure that getting your point across doesn't result in her hating u.
this just hits too close to home for me...my mom, too, has cancer.
i like to run my fingers through my wavy hair...
i'm just talking to the two of you...
the right woman will come along if u are patient...
i want my wife to grow as well...
he's obviously shy... maybe u should make a move...
the doctor was surprised as well...
if you have fun with both of them at once, she'll most likely have rough sex with you.
where ya live  i could come over and you could practice kissing me.
maybe you think its a no, but it's a no.
no offense...maybe because your name is freakgirl...but if you were to show your face...maybe not.
guys don't... just little boys.
maybe ask if they want to go out on a date sometime soon...
it happenned to me 2 times...
you shouldn't go out with a guy because you feel the 'necessity' to.
you wouldn't be asking if you really wanted to be with him.
and i just hope it never passes!
most women are waiting for a guy to tell her his true feelings...
women... are more passionate during sex...
always try to impress her...
leaning towards me and kissing me gently on the forehead...
i'm not that type of person, but i know plenty of people like that.
she's just worried about herself...no, that shouldn't happen on a first date.
ok, depends on how deep u start to feel for this boy!
in advance... thanks for the pep talk...
why do they want to get married...
we like to be approached softly......with a little bit of chasing...
in any case i married my husband and i wonder if u know the reasons in addition to love.
i'd like a trip to an amusement park or a museum...
i have feelings for a person and need to know if im in love.
do you like fake nails or manicured nails...
first, plan what you want and don't worry about what everyone else wants.
now we do all of these things together  i dont know what i should do.
i don't understand u...
i asked him if he still liked me and he said he does but he doesn't act that way.
i like the perfume you wear...
like being able to unwrap starburst candies with your tongue... women like it.
i think most guys dont care, but it kinda depends on the person.
its got nothing to do with being vulnerable, young or submissinve.
don't get married so early in the relationship...
you're not a good person and you plan to be unfaithful to your wife.
be the best version of yourself and if he's impressed he'll talk to you.
you don't wanna be with anyone but that person...
he's getting married, stop looking at it...
did u tell her the annoying nature of her daily check-ins with you?
when i moved in i got asked out by my neighbor...
most teenaged boys like teen girls like fornication.
he played a good game of basketball...
don't worry...
are you someone......who likes arguing and fighting?
if his affections moved away from her and toward you, he probably would've quit the romance to be with you.
the most important thing is don't try to hit at the person that wronged you.
one guy willing to move twenty-one hours and 14 hundred miles just to be with me.
..have u seen a doctor yet?
maybe she's not a slut, but the thin woman sure was.
you should just live an active life and dont waste my time...
its like overindulging in chocolate and then complaining because you've gained weight.
i went there and he was there.
if he's single...go for it.
if you don't like guys like that, they usually become the ones who beat their wives.
are you...or are u not attracted to him?
if you're sure, then you should tell your parents if you haven't already done so.
lots of people will probably reject you...
do u think he has the same feelings for u...
some guys only say that word if they mean it...
it looks like he likes you and you should show him how u feel.
i'm of the opinion that everyone should keep their own name...
friends are forever because guys come and go...
try to imagine... it was considered love...
i think u should be ready even if your relationship survives 4 seasons.
all right, some guys like women of that type and others not so much.
if you wanna have kids, then be a homemaker.
younger guys and older women...is that a good idea or not?
he wants to keep going...
you need to stay faithful to your husband...he's the one you swore your vows to.
so... there is no alternative to the proper label of love...
also...your self-esteem is very important...
i say those things and i'm female...
trust me girls can be just as perverted...
flowers are nice... even if they dont last long...
there are movies i have yet to see...
she's a very sweet girl...just the person you're looking for!
try to use your brain and not your manhood... maybe she doesn't like you.
no disrespect intended... but it kinda sounds like a lady's name.
i wouldn't take the trouble to call him back...
no women i'm attracted to in my list so i pick my neighbors spouse.
marraige is all about trust and communication...
don't listen to anyone else's advice...
what should i do to be happy with her...
give them a rose... and express your love for them...
its weird, i agree, but its not bad.
u gotta see what's right for you both...
they are good enough for a guy but they aren't as sophisticated as us.
exactly... especially when she got sick...
due to...as you know...attempt to look for your loved...however, use caution!
i can't go any further without more info...
kissing is something you can't do wrong or right...
take time to decide...
hanging out with guys is ok...
just think about the things you like and get the same in return... kinda like a massage with one's tongue.
my bf was definitely my best friend...  that makes it complete euphoria.
i guess it's more of a trust issue...
i need someone to help me figure this out...
then move on if he still doesn't like you.
he probably isn't interested either...
try to make it yourself whenever possible...
can u do anything else besides work and fix things?
i told her i really loved her...
it seems that all of the senior students think that freshmen girls are promiscuous, which sucks.
so... how do i just kiss him?
if you look in the deleted stuff it should be there...
hope u find a nice girl to date...
i don't think its a good idea, you're not there for that purpose.
its a very long list...
i'd say back on the mountain, you'll be happy even if it's a guy.
if you dont base your relationship on sex then its ok.
i'll most likely tell her soon because she's my best friend...in any case, any help would be appreciated...
yeah, and it's a portender of misfortune to see the betrothed at the marriage ceremony.
hold on and stay strong and good luck!
um...a little get-together for relatives...
if you're not sure about the performance part of it, then don't do it.
i'm married now...
i think its totally dependent on age and upbringing...
once you have kids, u gonna have to decide on a last name.
your kid will find it hard enough growing up without a father...
bald guys look like kids to me and i don't find it sexy.
you should give it a chance...  if you end up breaking up with that person, its gonna be harder to be friends with them.
ask what the score of the last game was...
if you are dating the guy you love you need to get rid of your ex.
the best and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married.
of course...let me get to know u more...
i prefr a c or d. anythign bigger is a waste.
deceive and deceive and then fabricate some more...
they haven't done it before and the pleasure is twice as good!
my wife doesn't like to wear those...
we dont know what u look like...
because opposites attract......and we always find a partner for life.
i think its better than my personal life...
don't go anywhere with your new date like you went with your ex.
talk with your best friend and see if it's ok...
it sounds weird but it worked for me in about 3 to 5 days.
i dont like it when he teases you about little things.
no... because i'm not married yet.
a lot of guys like heavyset women......they are mostly african american.
i most enjoy expressing my feelings to women with poems... has anyone written one for their significant other?
i've already expressed my love to her and she expressed her concern about ruining our relationship as friends.
if you like him, then you dont care, stay with him.
do they mock u when u are with him...
i like those guys since i'm a guy and i'm not required to invite a date to the affair.
u shouldn't get married if u feel this strongly about it.
its really dependent on whether or not a person is vain...
you gotta move on and start a relationship with someone who doesn't hate you.
you should get acquainted with her and sooner or later one of you will ask the other out.
i asked him if he was blowing me off...
maybe some vulgar young guys like the younger asian ladies...
make sure its your decision...
tell him you want to keep it casual...
is he not treating you well...you should be happy...
this situation is a tough one with lots of problems...
they've been pretty good years, not always the easiest...
we've been seeing each other......every day for about 4 to 5 years.
imagine im the guy you want and then date me.
it never hurts anyone to flirt a little...
u should just stick with what u feel inside...
i wish u luck...
is it bad if i don't kiss the girl i've been with for 8 months?
its a woman's decision...
i think they look better......than many other countries.
its gonna be ok the day after...
see if she's avaliable for dinner and a movie...
some guys don't think of their partner till they get to it.
just ask the question in english...i can't understand you.
i'm sorry, but i've never felt that way.
remember......no bird has ever tried to fly with one wing.
i often think about this...
you'll never find a significant other if you seem to be despondent.
i met agirl recently and i wanna know if she likes me.
don't just sit around and wait for the phone to ring...
be quiet and be whatever sexual orientation you want...
many 20-somethings are in relationships with 27-somethings, so the 20-somethings feel insecure...
if he comes to his senses, great, if not, you should move on.
he may love you...but he may want to disappoint his dad.
you'll just humiliate yourself if you apologize to him without making a mistake...don't get weak!
u should take action before its too late...
this girl doesn't want a guy who deceives her...
i'd like to hear the opinion of an african american woman on this subject...
please help me win this debate against her...
almost without exception (not always) those are guys similar in age to yourself, more or less.
when will pepole start to realize this??
im not sure what i should do...
you go to a bar and drink till you get inebriated...
i acted like that in the company of my current romantic partner...
if you have to ask......that's a negative.
don't sit there and wait till he realizes you are a good one.
even though i'm getting divorced, i'm still stuck with this.
you'll be fine...just enjoy yourself...
your girlfriend will just think you're being a jerk.
you can't fix the relationship with her parents, but you might be able to fix the relationship with her friends...why do you ask?
personally right now i would refrain from marrying any girl who wants to relinquish her name, but that's just my feeling.
maybe you should try to date young women... given the tendency by men to be offensive...
i went out with my ex for 3 years and then he/she cheated.
you'll know in time, and i recommend seeing what happens in 6 months.
well the one i like goes something like this...
not all guys break up with their woman...
going there is great fun......and there are lots of things to do.
is it ok to kiss on the first date...
i have a girl friend that i'm close with...
they lust for each other...
if he does, you should tell him that you want to be with him and it was a mistake to break up.
my friend tells me i'm too nice and i should tell him no.
but... there's always an exception, isn't there?
not all guys......but some guys do.
by doing so......you're still able to keep your name.
approach her... say hi... and ask if she's single...
that really bugged me sexually but i ran away.
girls who are heavier can still be sexy...
not every one is going to college...
practice unwrapping starburst and tying the stems with your tongue...
if you keep talking to him for another week, he's gonna think he's married to you.
i'll pay if i can get your vote for the best answer...
you should look for somewhere in public......where you will feel most comfortable.
flirt with him...and see his reaction...
and it eases the pressure i'm feeling to invite someone...
just say u gonna go out with me...
she doesn't forget my mistakes...
how should i approach her without her thinking i'm just another guy with bad intentions?
as a guy...i may have some insight...
don't worry, you're only 13...
always go trail riding with friends...
if the two of you really love each other, then you'll work things out.
eye contact is the key...
i can lift him...
he just has to start over and get your trust back.
i was with my ex boyfriend in 2nd grade and then in 4th grade and then again in 8th.
why u wanna ask her out?
well i hope u'll read this info very thoroughly...
try playing 'truth or dare' together...
wait till you find out and then go from there.
its stupid because you need a theory class for that...
just quit if u dont eat something like that...
i keep thinking about sex with her...
the only way you gonna know is if you confront him and ask him directly.
jamie is gonna ask rubi out on a date.
the relationship is still happening because neither of you have the courage to end things.
maybe its just interesting for them to learn about it...
he dribbles, shoots, and scores : 2 points...
do guys really like bigger women?
he loves you too, but only time can tell what's gonna happen.
if a guy really likes you, he'll understand you.
we've started our own sins...
his answer works for me...
you can still love him...but you need to move on.
a woman that is smart is a turn-on...
i think its wrong that they cant go out with her.
my sister closes her eyes to get ready when she kisses someone...
i met my last boyfriend while i was driving in a roundabout...
he's, however, getting married this month...
should i just let it go and move on...
u replaying everything that you did to me...
sounds like you guys are already married...
first...why was the relationship not broken?
he may call you back if u give him space...
u should tell more people...
just take it one step at a time... think how he lost something positive...
say hi harold......when will we be going out to dinner together?
no... not if u need to ask...
you gotta go to school, you can still come home or call you friends and family.
i wanted to never again have sexual activity...
allow him to approach you... if you do anything, you will seem obsessed with him.
some people don't do it because of their religion...
u should be really happy with yourself...
one does what feels comfortable to them  so, no, i feel it is a choice.
you gotta think about that and it should help in deciding if or not he's trusty!
i didn't mean to ask...do you think women are sexually attractive and beautiful?
ask if they're gonna get violent...
sounds like you like selling yourself too much...
see if the guy you like is willing to go out of his way for you...
but its not defined as you both being unable to have affection for one another.
if they dont know anythign about you, how would they know?
what......why do other people's opinions matter?
if you could have 4 qualities in your girl...what would they be?
women like it when guys are thoughtful...
i feel silly, weird, and exuberant...
just keep it cool...it might be a little hard to get!
see the way she walks...
he shouldn't care if u at a dance together.
women are attracted to confident guys...
ask her out on a date after ness...
u should make an appointment with a therapist...
i guess i just keep feeling all-consuming romantic love for him.
but that's ok i'm generous if you understand my point.
go ahead and get something that you can't get rid of...
you've only met guys with a specific taste...
but i'm not telling you that you have to be celibate till then.
don't force him to dance if he dont want to...
i'm a guy and i'm gonna tell you what i'm aware of.
my girlfriend won't tell me she loves me to my face...
we dont know if she's sincere...
can u help me get to know her...
i have long black hair and my husband and i are pretty fond of it.
people just make their decisions fast...
maybe they're trying to be something they're not?
no you won't, my friend, i was married to someone totally inconsiderate.
u gotta stay away from your guy friend...
i'm looking for a girl who wants to spend time with me...
but for me at least it's been the best thing.
i met a guy once, romance galore, we first met during this incredible rainstorm...
u'll get paid more if u willing to work more...
i wonder if its gonna ever be the same after that...
it could be you just have to pick one and know why you picked that one.
wait another 4 years...
i'm glad i got brown hair...
if you want a gift for your husband i would suggest sports things or tools.
that's not what you can be...
the problem is he did the worst thing he could have done by cheating on me recently.
use your imagination to picture yourself with him at night...
it hurt a lot and i started to bleed.
it could mean so many things...
10 years of separation is just not that appealing...
you gotta do more then just make eye contact...
do u want all your friends to be with you forever...
i hate him because of the way he acted...
i know......what i want in a relationship.
it happened in the river while people were watching...it was funny!
if you're really hot you should show him your boobs...
so it's natural for that guy...
i get happy when i see an ad for malaysia on tv.
go out and do everything you couldn't do when you were in a relationship.
its very possible to enjoy giving pleasure more......than you enjoy receiving it.
is it normal to still have feelings for him after 6 months...
if you start to feel it coming on, then start the foreplay.
guys will always find you to be attractive no matter what, usually.
its a challange...
just ask a girl walking by...they are everywhere in thailand...
its very important to last between 30 and forty-five minutes...
my concern......is that i'm deeply attracted to him.
its because it's buy one, take one...
i didn't realize pakistan is so conservative.
we can play together and be best friends...
i rarely see him in school but i have seen him at my brother's basketball games.
you didn't give us very useful info... where do all of you live?
u gotta admit why u're attracted to her...
its another way to say they don't like you.
everyone has to break up at some point...
i worked there for a while and met a guy that i love.
i'll probably just go and see...
and for what reason...just to accomplish your intent...
woman... more men exist in the world......with a fondness for overweight women...... contrary to your beliefs.
i didn't think he would remember, it was casual when i said it.
girls don't like guys who are self absorbed...
u gotta look...
either a cd or dvd will be ok...
you two toil rigorously to get the best!
should she express any interest... she'll call at a later time...
i really care about you and can't stop thinking about you when we are apart.
should i give him another chance... at some point in time?
if it feels like your love is fading......don't ignore it.
daniel has never read a manga...
if they actually apply... try using some of these...
the same thing has happened to me too...
or maybe she just wants to go out with other people?
pick the one you like the most...
be ready to let her go...
i sometimes reveal details about my problems too early in a relationship and maybe i told this guy too much.
i guess its kinda common, but i'd just go with it.
dump him... it'd be better...
sometimes...but you gotta watch your significant other...
you get the popcorn if he gets them first...
what does it matter if its a rebound relationship for you both?
my girl is the zealous person i know and i love her more for it.
one day......you will find a man......who really deserves you.
be strong...and don't lose hope...
so... how about blue and green...
some men do, some don't...
i want a girl who is kind, and intelligent...
its not as bad as it could have been...at least it's not bella.
its more like 65% or 70% and not 90%.
what good did it do?
i dont know what it is that she wants...
my eternally close friend hates my partner and hopes for the end of our relationship, but that won't happen.
we were just spending a little bit of time together...
you still got a thousand... at least.
all my friends wanna do is engage in heavy kissing...
happy b-day to you...
since females experience thought through their brain...
in my opinion u should compliment her, ask her name, act normal, and act normal.
how much time must go by before you can decide it takes too much time and she has no real interest?
girls don't think it is cool  they think that men who smoke are bad because they are killing themselves.
i just find myself around guys i'm not attracted to, i'm sure you know the outcome.
the timing with the older guy wasn't right...you'll see.
take both of them out on a date...
im my only sister's maid-of-honor and i want it to be perfect.
i have the worst time sleeping because my bf snores!
if they dont get along then they shouldn't spend time together  why does it matter what they think?
don't let her know that you wanna be with her forever and you probably stand a better chance of that being the way it is.
tell her to just call you about important things...
i gotta stop right now, cos i'm ready to relieve myself.
for me i could start to forget about you once 3 days have passed.
or is it just that you want to say that?
before anyone gets hurt...i agree with the other person...
people don't like being played with like they were yo-yo.
im gonna like it being done to me.
u can impress her with love and affection...
men have penis and women have clitoris...
by this time......you should love your wife for everything the two of you have done.
i don't need a high maintenance woman i want a friend
i hate it personally but i like the one that's straight.
if she's fond of him...a motivation exists...
there's no one you can trust more than a good friend...
its weird but maybe i don't know i'll talk to my friend later next to his locker.
if you're average... breast size won't really matter.
im a guy so i also have feelings.
try to contact their question and answer team...they will help you with the process... enjoy your day!
i like intelligent, fun, and captivating women...
good...the girl answered the first question for me...
if its a salacious photo......they would like to have sex.
where u been meeting these women from the philippines...
maybe u should take him out to lunch, movie, or something...
i don't because i like guys that look normal.
i had someone get really bad with me because i kept dating.
i love him but i'm just ready to move on.
yeah, ask for permission... watch how fast she gets violent with you.
guys think they are special and that only certain women are good enough for them.
i wanna have sex here and there...
i've heard it so many times...
sounds like you're the alpha in the relationship...
wait for the one that will love you for you...
don't go to the place...it looks suspicious...
its all about the looks...
its time to forget about him, if you two are meant to be he will come back to you.
the guy i'm attracted to is angry with me...
do u like asian cuisine...
my cousin met up with an extreme deviant that she met online and he told her he was a salacious teenager.
should a question be asked......the message is......i haven't fallen in love yet.
don't even listen to what any person says...just watch the way they act.
keep your personality... dont let any man decide how you act.
i love him...what should i do?
just talk about the subject with your spouse...
if you just roll your eyes at him the challenge is almost non existent.
another option... you could tell her and have a fairy tale romance...
you are killing the romantic behavior by asking that inane question...or have you considered partaking in fun activities as a couple?
plus, engage in kissing......and inquiring as to ur kissing abilities.
jules sac is funny but he's mean too.
u wanna see my partner?
from my point of view, if a guy is very self-centered, i find it makes him far less appealing.
i know this cos i have a similar personality to your wife...
i dont think u are ready if u have to ask other people.
rip your shirt off and yell like tarzan does...
if you dont love your husband any longer, then move on and make room for another guy.
make it an honest compliment about her...
i'm interested in a boy in 6th grade too!
they feel insecure around less educated guys...
maybe we can go out on a date and find love with eachother...
if she tells the adminsitration, i'm gonna get expelled because its pakistan, not america.
my friend is in a relationship with someone online...
i like the feeling of cuddling with a big woman...
i think the bomb is much more simple...
i met                  from his side of the
anything that can't be easily moved...
start a friendship first......then let the relationship develop.
i got cheated on 3 of the 4 years i was in a relationship.
attack him because he's interested in someone else?
don't let them know in advance but just let them know once you are in bed together.
its not so important here in america...
be confident and always believe in yourself...don't become arrogant... always make eye-contact and listen to what she has to say...
let it take its course...
i know because i date someone like that...
my wish is that i had paid attention to the comments from my circle...
leave him if he misbehaves...
do whatever makes you happy...
we tried to move on but it didn't work out.
if you're not confident enough to ask... someone else may ask...
my twin wont talk or listen to me...
she'll answer the question......because most girls are polite.
u married him for a reason...
ask him if he would like to go to the movies with u...
some women can't seem to find guys their own age that are sexy.
it didnt matter...we are just friends...
in such a situation......take some self-defense courses...
it just seemed like that to me anyway...
how inebriated is this woman gonna get?
you should take the time to get acquainted with both of them......without dating either of them.
he loves you... you're aware of that?
u can join a community that has live and webcam chat...
i gotta tell ya... those were good times.
if you're promiscuous, then he is as well.
caucasian women are imitating all the guys!
i'd be crazy if she called me 5 times a day.
you may be the only one with whom he can have sex...
inform the miscreant of his need to vacate...
wow... how old are u at?
they think they can control the lives of others when they can't...
u'd just let him go if u like him.
a person i'm able to act naturally with...
the rest is simple from this point on...
tell them i love u... it will tell you everything...if they wait to say it back.
i just got out of a 3-year romance with the father of my baby.
good luck in your search for your perfect match...
even though time has passed......i still love him.
he already knows you care for him...has he said anything about it?
everyone has their own perferances on who they find attractive...
my wife is a forgiving woman...
what's gonna happen if u ask him to be casual lovers?
i like him and he says he'd date me if i was single.
women can be worse then men...
maybe she's trying to use you...
..don't do things that might be harmful to you...
u'd be very surprised to see the type of people that are attracted to him.
keep doing so till you get to age 25......your appeal wont diminish in such a time.
so that's the way to go if you're set on that.
do guys know what they want in a relationship...
if you need to break up emotionally, then you are gonna have some problems.
but if you get used to it and like it somewhat, go with it.
remember... the vow is till death do you part!
there's nothing wrong with her asking for your phone number...
if the answer is ye, then why do i hear so many girl saying flowers won't last?
don't be shallow and start with her looks...
asking her that question shouldn't bother her if you two are in a serious relationship.
i'd pick maui or bahamas...
the problem is if u gonna ask her out while at work or not.
the way he asked me out was very ingratiating
u have set up a double standard...
i can't offer a wife-based opinion, but i'm hoping my opinion is just as valuable.
u are justified in feeling disappointed and angry...
when he got to his station... he left the train...
start from the beginning and then work your way up to 20 years down the road.
don't be afraid to say no...
i dont care what she says, leave it alone, she's in too much pain.
for one thing it kinda sucks your job if it doesn't work out.
u could try dancing at a club...
many times i have missed out on a great opportunity by talking to myself about someone else.
how can i get him to stop pestering me...
when you are 18-20... sometimes you say what you don't mean.
i wonder why he shaved his legs...
you should be nice...make eye contact...and smile...
what does everyone think...
this question is for the guys... (a) what size woman do u like?
she doesn't want u to like her just for her good looks.
good luck is all i can say...
there was only one time i told a girl i loved her and meant it.
if she says yes......then go pick them up.
if you want her to be your friend, it's probable that you want a deeper relationship.
you'll hurt your loved ones if you keep secrets...
be authentic and show some machismo... thats what women, or at least most women, like.
don't worry about what others say...
any guy that says he would is more than likely not being entirely honest with himself.
forget him and date his brother...
death is like a box full of candy corn  it gives you cavities.
i wouldn't want a pair that big...
some like to believe because the way society dictates it i think we should rebel against society and appreciate curvier women.
that just makes her easier to have sex with...
call him if u feel that level of attraction to him...
its because you dont have any power over the decision...
its your life... make your own decisions...
as one gets older... keep getting younger and younger to make u feel better.
by the way, i'm not the kind of woman who likes a romantic dinner at home.
i'm just doing it so i'll get points...
its a risk you're gonna have to take...
work on your relationship but don't let him keep you locked up at home.
no matter what you decide to do......don't tell him too soon.
its not wise to date work colleagues...
if going to the cinema is good for you as a couple, take part in that.
it takes place prior to 3play and before 5play.
buy a toy specifically for sex that you both would like...
egotism is a man's thing...you just have to deal with it.
i agree with udaman...
i like him very much but i wanna make him not reject him.
i'm not thinking about him but i'm having dreams with him in them.
probably not till he finds another girl...
u need to date some new people...
you shouldn't do anything u will regret later...
one of the best rules of internet dating... chat via email and over the phone.
yeah i did it and it was a blast.
there are lots of cheap ideas... find what you're interested in and work from there.
you might just be looking for a class of guys that think the hell out of you.
you'll find mrs. right...
you know you were meant to be together if you can break the wind in front of each other.
hope i see some of it very soon...
just approach her and start a conversation...
well i dont have any knowledge of your age, which would be of no help.
yeah... it's an unhealthy behavior...
we dont have room in our society for crazy monsters like this...
did you mean, 'seems more sexy?'
is this a stupid question...
its like saying...what can stop me after i've already done it?
picking the right date can save you so much money...
thats all i got to say on the matter...
why is it so hard for guys to say the word love...
and if she loves you...your girlfriend should accept that...
then he asked me if i could go with you...
a decent amount of guys just want sex...
usually its caused by a spasm in the back...
they should try taking our last names...
you're gonna lose your friend over a guy.
u'll know if he's attracted to you!
i love that they like the challange...
give her a mix tape or cd...
i wanna be happy...
don't try to have sexual relations...
on occasion when i'm in a relationship with someone......i suffer embarrassment.
when you're ready... it's worth the wait...
u are too precious for those people...
does that mean he's attracted to me?
i think the guy should take the first step in a relationship...
if i could... i would have kept my last name...
you gotta seperate the bad thing and move on.
ask him how he is once in a while...
try new things and try new things in order to meet people...
i still have feelings for my ex and i'm mad with my cousin due to my ex liking her.
it wasnt a good idea after all...
celebrate valentine's day......with happiness, gift-giving, and fun.
not for anything other than appearance...
they never had a chance...
but i think they both have feelings for me.
they like little girls...
don't forget to pick and vote for the best answer...
i've been with my husband for 4 years  we just recently got married in december of 2005.
the pier and the museums are great to visit  there are also many great restaurants and hotels.
sometimes one of them will cheat on the other...
don't worry, i don't have that many options myself.
my mom books trips at 'pat@alanatvl.com'
the time has been more than 6 months and it seems i can't move on.
u need to move to Mass.
it really doesn't matter, but i'm fine with a handful.
some women prefer non-perishable gifts that are long-lasting...
she's strong, loving......but not as happy as she thought.
you are young if you are interested in 6th graders...
size, shape, looks, and other surface features dont matter at all.
you're asking what their stance is on gay relationships...
i agree...kiss him and he'll have a response for you.
he gave me his cell phone so i could put my number in it...
if you wanna enjoy your time, try checking out some night clubs, bars, or gyms...
so i'd say they do, but not often.i hope this is helpful.
if u in florida look me up...
ask her out on a date...
i'm sorry, but i don't know...i wish the both of you luck.
hey, i'm interested in visiting your country...
search for another attractive woman in order to make her jealous...
dont ask that question if you dont want to get upset.
she knows how much i care about him so i dont know what to do.
and lastly... does he always happen to be staring?
u should try foreplay... it slows down the pace...
fair skinned women have a tendency to look paler when their hair is black.
i wasn't gonna let her come in first.
never tell her she's fat...
wanna hear a bad joke?
you know how it would be if you didn't play...the guilt trip.
it looks like he's enjoying his self too much while you're gone.
yeah, i dont think anyone would...
some couples are never gonna be that comfortable with each other.
its pretty obvious that guys aren't much better...
i never went on a second date with him...
maybe because you are the most attractive young lady they have ever met.
you have found your true love and you need to be with them...
you dont need to prove anything if the guy is good enough.
you're too young to even talk about kissing...
order one online and then a magical stork will bring one to you...
it gets harder as time goes on...
just go on with your life and find an alternative person!
how old are they??
all you gotta do now is smile...
the bottom line is you gotta stop talking to him and stop thinking of him.
the girls that complain about the short life of flowers are just unappreciative...
i'm laughing because that's why i'm single...
the women that are pretty... or have a great personality...
i don't like girls.
u should refuse to see your cousin and your bf...
i dont remember ever giving a girl a christmas gift unless i cared for her.
who's gonna know if rural women feel more sexually attractive?
i met mine at a carnival...
my husband likes my personality...
she's not a false witness...
if they fail to do so......the time has come to continue apace.
decide......what style of arrangements and flowers......you would like.
in case he has no objection......what if the other person has a different point of view?
you're probably just too good for him...
she lets me work on my trucks and watch cartoons...
lime green... more of a summer wedding color...
is there anything i can do about it...
the right relationship just happened on its own...
appearance is not important unless you are trying to prove something...
just to be honest...i can handle the truth...
u could start the day by eating breakfast out, then go for a nice walk.
i did this before and my friend was mad that i deleted him.
don't have sex...
be nice when you tell her...
the two of you should kiss when u are ready...
ask questions to her (not just conversing)
i think you're a good guy...most likely she likes you quite a bit.
when she calls... reply with a text message...
no, its totally unacceptable, you are just wasting your health because women just hate it.
you gotta find someone you like and ask them to be your valentine.
u should tell her u miss and love her...
if no action......you have to ask it of him once more.
some don't have it in them but some do.
he'll most certainly not stop u at your request.
its a nice picture of george clooney...
my partner wants me to change my look...
those replies are arrogant...i'm so much more attractive...
poor teeth, horrible breath, and horrible body odor...
no words will make the situation better...
the world would be happier if men knew what women want...
u wanna have oral sex with another guy?
i don't want you to marry...
yeah i'm a guy so i dont really have to pay.
if he wants to wear my pants...he just has to ask.
