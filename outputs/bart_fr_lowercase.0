what if it is a rebound relationship for both of you?
good luck in your search for the one.
why does everyone seem to want someone that they can't have and know that they shouldn't have?
do you like to argue and fight?
so if you are set on that, that is the way to go.
my boyfriend of three years cheated.
work at it, but do not let him keep you locked up at home.
other than those two things, just ask him once in a while.
also, men get bored and tire out way before women do.
she is strong and loving, but most importantly, she wasn't as happy as she thought she was.
that is one way of saying i do not like you.
king had a song about this: only your mother loves you, and you might be jiving.
he loves you, too, girl. time will tell.
he wants me to change how i look.
i know i have someone to come home to.
did you go online because you want to have sex, but you have to be careful?
do you want all your friends forever?
it does not mean that you are slutty.
going to a club and dancing.
do not go anywhere you went with him or her.
they are a lot of fun, there is plenty to do.
it all depends on when you are ready.
stay 100 miles away from this man.
just be prepared because if it does happen again, it will happen again.
i am looking for the girl who wants to spend time with me.
at least not until he has another girlfriend.
my wife says, "we do not wear that shit."
if you are asking, then you should break-up w/ and open yourself to other options.
why do gays want to get married?
saying sorry to him without commiting a mistake is humilation to your self. do not ever get weak.
do you have to rush your decision?
they both do not respect your feelings.
take it seriously and think about how many cocky girls are out there.
she is too afraid to ask him out.
get a grip. how can you love someone that you do not even communicate with?
i would ask you out, but i live inregon and have no idea where you live.
they have never proformed before and it doubles the plesure.
i will probably go and see one.
either way, best of luck, i am just glad that i have brown hair.
send me a message at honorarius@yahoo.com and i will tell you.
it is simply a challenge.
well, you are a girl, so I will help you out.
do not tell them, but let them find out once you are in bed with her.
if i would have kept my last name, it would have been a freak name.
i hardly ever see him in school, but usually i see him at my brothers basketball games.
he is telling that to some gurls, as he is a womanizer.
drop his buttt, there are plenty of fish in the sea of amore.
i know because i am just like your wife.
when she calls, text her back.
no, he is five-four and he is six-two.
do you know the number one rule? do not trust anyone.
we tried breaking up a few times, but it never happened.
yes, some because they are thin and skinny, while anorexic girls are a turn on.
if you have a penis, then there is no problem. you just need to penitrate her pussy with your erect penis.
in that case, take some defense classes.
i just got out of a three-year relationship with my child's father.
what happened when the politician took Viagra?
hello, my name is xxxxxx and has been working for me for years.
i can only say that women are complicated.
we prefer soft approch and a bit of chasing.
you would be genuinly suprised in the type of people that come to them.
it is very fun and enjoyable, especially when you meet each other after texting for a few months.
hey, i am in nyc and i will help you out if you are around!
it sounds strange, but it worked in about three-five days for me.
do not worry, i aint working very well either.
why does it matter what they think if they do not get along and spend time togather?
if he is, then you have a good man.
if he likes you, you will know.
i suppose that is normal, but i will move on.
the rest is easy from there.
i like any man that is funny.
girl, only you can decide on this.
why do you ask this question ?????
do not tell everyone just because you think it is right.
a ten-year gap is nice.
if he still does not like you, then move on.
yes, i see him every week in psr, but i simply cannot talk to him.
beacuse they feel insecure with less educated men.
for one thing, if it doesn't work out, then you lose your job.
i hope to god it does not ever pass.
only the ones that are not worth your time.
of course, and it is all about looks.
you do not have any reason to hate each other.
if you do not, you will always wonder.
some people choose not to because of their religion, others do not.
give it a chance because if you break up with them, it will be harder to be friends.
best of luck to you.
men who were not ready to committ.
this is a big day in both of your lives, it should not be done quickly and without thought.
i am 55 years old and still live at home with my mammy. what is wrong with that?
one man is willing to travel 21 hours/1,400 miles just to be with me.
i must not be ugly enough.
that is okay. i am a giver.wink, wink.
you can depend on women if you want.
remember, it takes two, not one.
if he really did not like her and did not like you, then he would have already dumped her for you.
hang around until the bar closes, or visit a prison.
please do not miss out on this one.
whether you believe it or not, women hate cocky men.
you should stick with the wats inside of you.
hell, it happened to me twice.
perhaps you are young, i do not know.
no matter what he says, action speaks louder than words.
there is nothing in the world better than a large boned gurl.
even if he is wealthy, do not sell your self.
just moved to sacramento, a homosexual male, age 30.
the people who are around you now, such as your friends, should like you no matter what.
because they like the little titis and pussys.
wait until you are older, and if you both still feel the same way, then go for it!
yes, i am not one of those people, but i know there are many of them.
no, not if you have to ask.
do you want to suck another man's c**k?
because they are a man and they are not as fisticated as we are.
"... does that mean he likes me?"
do not worry about him, just immerse yourself in school so you can lern, and then enjoy the day.
i dated one and i know.
look at the way she walks.
no, at least i hope not.
hello, i am looking to visit your country.
should i give him another chance?
is the same man you want to be in a relationship with?
i went, and there he was.
that is what i called it, but why?
that way you can still go by your last name.
both of you work hard to get it right.
i told her i liked her and she said she would not want to ruin my friendship.
you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat.
show her your naked pictures.
it is very important to last at least 30-45 minutes.
however, i am not telling you to be celibate until then.
if he is flirting with her, then jump him.
i love curly hair, i like to run my fingers through it.
i want my wife to grow as well.
well, that is the way it is i suppose.
one girl, michelle, who probably wouldn't mind being named, spoke up and said she did not believe in it.
i can simply toss him to the side and forget about him like last night's trash.
however, he was a little busy after that.
i do not know what to do because she knows how much i care about him.
if you do eat something like that, then just stop.
it could be that you need to pee or the last dream you had.
you know, if he wants to wear my pants, all he has to do is ask.
if you were friends before and have stronger feelings now, then it should be o>k.
i would like to try again.
find out what style of arrangements you would like and choose flowers.
lie, lie, lie, and lie some more.
wait until you find out for sure first, then proceed from there.
if you two are at a dance, he should not really care.
trust him, but do not bring it up again.
honestly, most women are simply waiting for the man to tell her how he truly feels.
yes, i would love to meet the ladys.
i actually ponder this one time and again.
i met this guy once, very romantic, and i met him in a huge rainstorm.
now, some men like girls like that and some do not.
it comes right after three and before five.
when i fall in love, i feel stupid.
if you have to ask, then you are not in love.
if you begin to feel it comming on, then begin the play again.
if you do not understand, please give me the answer.
i saved a good $500-600 doing my own flowers, and it was no trouble at all.
i just got a divorce, and so did he.
do not ask a girl about her boyfriends because i am a boy.
if you show a little toghness, that is what girls like, at least most of them do, but mostly be yourself.
follow your heart, it is neva wrong.
they bother you all day long.
see if he calls, e-mails, or even cares.
you can do a civilian arrest.
a spasm in your back usually occurs.
by now, you may love your wife for everything you have endured.
good luck and i hope everything goes well.
say that i love you, and if you wait to say it back, it says it all.
try asking her out again and see what she says.
however, there is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
ask her questions (do not just talk).
when you first fall in love, your gregarious, funny, and silly are happy just thinking about that person.
remember, there is more then one.
i think they look better than a lot of other nations out there.
we got married all over again.
all in all, i do not think it really matters.
i am sure as hell not driving five hours just to hang out unless i really really like her.
how often can you have sex with pam anderson?
i told her that i loved her and truly meant it.
think about what it has brought about.
the thing is, a person does not like to brake others heart.
give a rose and express your love.
i like thick because i feel cheated with a thin one.
remember, until death do you part.
bcozz, we always find a life partner that we attract on the opposite side.
what the hell are you talking about?
if you continue talking to him for another week, he may think he is married to you.
women do not want much, just some acknowldgement and sometimes help.
at least that is what it seems to me.
do not be afraid to say no.
dump him. there are always more fish in the sea.
to me, a good dose does not matter, but a hand full is quite enough for me.
choose the one that adores you the most.
you have still released at least a thousand.
you go to a bar and get drunk.
give it some time and give it a thought.
no, you should not leave them, just teach them what to do to please them better.
bembie hit the nail on the head.
no. men kiss when they are ready.
julesac is funny, but mean.
if you are asking this, you must have distanced yourself from her and yet remain a friend.
do not forget to choose and vote for the best answer.
do not try to figure it out, that is jus the way it is.
i do not know, but i do know of another website that i go to.
yes, it depends on how much you begin to have feelings for this boy.
he must be a control freak.
it all depends on the girl or the man and how crested the girl is in the man.
look, try and get out to meet people.
usually it is multiple things, not just one.
if you really really really really really really really really like them.
for the men: (a) do you prefer a larger woman or a smaller woman?
if all you do is argue, it is not worth it.
what makes it worse is that i have been out with him for four years.
you just have to be patient and the right girl will come along.
unless you do not love your husband anymore and have room for another man.
wife, then you can do more with out comminting a sin.
she definitely wants you to think she is attractive, but she does not want that to be reason number one.
it depends, some days i want to have sex, others i do not.
also, they are more passionate in love makin.
if you play w/ both at the same time, she will probably f-cking get the sh%$ out of you.
because he did not work, hit me, used guilt trips, was a big mama's boy, etc.
perhaps because you are the most beautiful girl they have ever seen.
it really depends whether someone is vain or not.
someone i can be myself with.
send me your picture and contact me.
stay away from this friend.
the doctor can not even believe it.
yes, for sure, especially when she throws up.
if not, then do not sweat it.
i could give you some pointers.
if you feel your love is fading, do not just sit there and do nothing.
i will not stay with someone i do not trust.
i only once told a girl that i loved her, and i meant it.
you married him, and it was for a reason.
rip off your shirt and do a Tarzan yell.
yes, girl down there, do not have sex.
they accept this in thier culture.
always take a trail ride with a friend.
you did not give us very good information.  do you all live in one house?
move on. what if he is attractive? looks aren't everything.
what is most important is to be yourself.
do not be disappointed and be angry.
sorry, i would never have felt that way.
i definitely do not like any girl who would make my life difficult.
if he gets them first, you get the popcorn.
practice and ask if you are doing well.
however, if you are certain, then first tell your parents that you have not done anything yet.
well, i met mine at the carnival.
it sounds like a rhetorical question.
i believe everyone should keep their own name.
the first kiss should feel like you are in hevan.
there is nothing but trouble there.
how do you make a woman happy to make a woman happy?
do not do things that can get you hurt.
i think of course you will make more money if you work hard.
please do not go up to her and tell her how good she looks.
i do not think it is a good idea, you are not there for this purpose.
go up to her and say, "hi, are you single?"
i think he would make a great valentine.
just be prepared to let her go.
rather than just sit there and wait until you are a good one.
just tell them, what are they going to do, slap you?
get a massage and get away from it all. hehe.
well, if you really like this man smile and make nice conversation with him.
take them both out at the same time.
it happened to me, and i am now dating that person.
only two points to make friends.
so you may be over looking the type of men who think the world of you.
preferrably someone who does not hate you.
we tried to move on, but it did not work.
when will people in this fucked up world finally realize that?
i would not bother calling him back.
try not to hang out with him and find another man.
look for another attractive woman, so she will be jealous.
in my opinion, you are not a hoe.
red is love, black is death.
if she likes him, then she does not like him. it is not his fault that she strays.
ask me anything after three days and i might start to forget about you.
find a girl who has talismans, she also must be prety.
there is no one you can trust more than a good friend.
start the day off with breakfast and perhaps a nice walk.
then go pick them up (if she says yes).
if yes, why do i hear some girl say that flowers are not going to last?
it may be interesting for them.
could it ever be the same?
it is not that bad, at least it is not bella.
could it be because some men are liars and have fat mouths?
you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances.
finally a culture that has it right.
my twin does not speak or listen to me.
if you want to get something you can not get rid of, then go ahead.
only, i am not thinking about him, but i am having dreams about him.
if you are talking ten, then i think it would be fine to get a video or computer game.
go for it and take the opportunity.
if he can't, then take him to a place where they have slowdances (dinner date, perhaps?)
i feel that this is most beautiful in a family life.
it is your choice not to hate one, i dislike them to say the least.
never get married without a prenup.
have a life and do not waste mine.
she says you are too good for her?
men come and go, but friends are forever.
it could mean a lot of things.
yes, it is normal because there are plenty of people who still like some that they broke up with.
i would like to see what a black female has to say about this.
men are stupid, who knows why they do what they do.
well, if they gave you their phone number, you do not have to wait at all.
they were masters of the universe.
i am in love and do not care who knows it.
whatever you do, do not try to have both of them at once.
if you really wanted to be with him, you would not be asking.
remember, being friends with someone online is fine, but there are limits.
when my sister kisses someone, she closes her eyes to get ready.
for me, i would not marry any women who did not want to change her name, but that is just me.
a small party for the family.
girls are perverts, they just hide it and act like it around other girls.
i am only in fifth grade. thank you!
you do what you want.
do not do that. it will not work.
if they do not, it is time to move on.
he is everything i have ever wanted, looks, money, etc.
yes, and it is bad luck to see the bride at the wedding.
no, she is not a liar.
shut the fuck up and be gay if you want to.
he had his nose pierced.
yup, i can lift him, he is only 185.
you need a therapist for that.
perhaps some perverted men like the very attractive asian women.
you should go see a shrink.
giving you stupid excuses against the wall, acting the way he did before.
be strong, and hang in there.
no, he is too large and i am too darned weak.
basically, if she is so drunk that she becomes a slob or slut, then yes, she is unattractive.
exchange letters, e-mails, chat online, talk over the phone, send packages, and just keep in touch.
especially if you do not feel like it.
he dribbles, he shoots, and he scores two points.
giving it up just for him to stick around is like selling your soul to the devil.
i cannot give you a wife view, but hopefully mine is just as good.
it takes the pressure off of me to ask someone.
it depends on the woman, it is better shaved.
ask in english terms. i cannot understand you.
hey, i am a man, but i will tell you a bit.
i like him very much, and i want to win him over and not push him away.
it seems that i really really really like this guy, but i do not know if he likes me back.
btw, the avatar looks familiar.
it has been over six months and i cannot seem to get over it.
perhaps he thinks he will be turned down. just ask. i would.
you have to think about that, and that should help you out on seeing if you can trust him.
picture the shape of a heart with you and her when you both first dated. it is special.
i am in college, and he is my only source of income until i get out.
listen, it is not that easy. i had an affair with my ex-boyfriend in 2nd grade, then again in 4th grade
i have been with this girl for eight months and we have not kissed. is that bad?
some men do not like breasts at all.
is it that she simply wants to see other people?
he has seen me every day for about four or five years.
there was a stop, so he got off the train.
i mean the worst, the absolute worst, is that she says no. take a chance and good luck!
however, i know exactly what i want in a relationship.
i would flirt and send flowers and candies to my self, then he would ask you out.
i also hate seeing my father unhappy.
i feel bad because i know that i snore often. most people do, right?
i like sos and need to know if i am in love.
if you truly love each other, then you can work out all the fighting.
because neither of you have the courage to call it quits.
however, that does not mean that large girls cannot be cute.
however, he is getting married this month.
but those men are jerks and you do not want them anwyay.
say will you go out with me?
you should get married only after you have been with a man for more than two years.
a man has a penis and a woman has clitoris.
desperate the bad thing and move on.
it would be easier to do if i were mad, though.
if she will inform the administration, i will be expelled because it is pakistan not america.
you should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will.
as i said, he already knows that you like him, so take a deep breath and ask him.
maybe you and i can get together sometime and we will find love with one another.
i would be, but i am only married.
play the field a bit now.
as everyone said, do not get married so early.
i just want to know have you been to the doctor yet?
pay attention to what the other person says.
just talk to your spouse about it.
if you are into sixth graders, you are obviously young.
i was thinking of a medium pink color, but with what color?
ask if they want to go somewhere with you.
a trip to an amusement park such as a roller coaster or even a museum.
or do men really prefer larger women?
the problem is that i really like him.
i would say, they do work out, just not a lot of the time. i hope this helps.
should i dump him because of his mother?
i did this before (accidentally) and my friend was upset that i deleted him.
i do not think i mind either way.
if that is her way, you could try it that way, or you could just keep your eyes open.
there are some that do, but you should be able to tel.
are you talking about your avatar?
i do not remember giving a girl a christmas present unless i liked her.
i do not know what to do.
try to be your best self and do not show off.
so, take it day by day, step by step, think of how he lost a good thing.
dang it, if only every man knew what women desire, the world would be a much happier place.
compliments, honesty and honesty make it about her.
i think hse will kill him.
it simply means that she is really interested in the man.
please do. i am thinking you would get slapped mid-reach or kicked in the groin.
only now she and i are both divorced.
if he/she wants to see you immediately, then have sex.
hey, it is better than her givin you a fake phone number to call.
tell her to move to mass.
if you feel this strongly about it, then perhaps you should not get married.
based on the pictures i have seen, i would say maui or the pajamas.
the man i like is angry at me.
when you are 13, do not even worry about it.
that way you do not have to worry about you calling him too much.
i am a man, and let me tell you, we love to chase.
thanks for the pep talk in advance.
we always seem to push the ones we love away.
they think they can control other people's lives when they cannot.
that is strange, but perhaps id prefer to talk to my friend by his locker.
i do not know. how would you like something stuffed up your butt?
if a man cares, he calls.
what special gift can i give my would be brother in law for his birthday?
he probably does not want to either.
hold her hands, look into her eyes, and say it, but only say it if you really love her.
some men do, and some do not.
hey, i really want to know, so please help me out.
the timing just wasn't right for it with the old man. you will see.
be kind and considerate. i will be disapointed if she is stupid.
it is one of the gifts we can always give ourselves.
i do not believe trust has to be earned, because how is that even possible?
so, if that is what you deff need to stop, it is fonky.
do not let her rule your life. she will just have to learn to deal with it.
i have yahoo email, and that works for me.
i would not worry too much about it.
yes, the trick ass hoe has never had a chance.
when you can fart in front of the one you are dating.
it depends on how old they are.
any man who does not know what he is doing is prolly not being entirely honest with himself.
if you flirt with him, the challange is not there.
if you need support emotionally, then you have some troubles.
20 to 32, she does not have to be younger than you.
my opinion is that she does not love you, but will try to use your brean not your hairdo.
if you want your girlfriend forever, then do not let her know that you want her forever, simple.
there are plenty of cheap ideas out there, just find what you like and work with it.
and if you are concerned about doing it performance wise, do not.
find a nother girl, and if that does not work, move back.
most often (but not always) there will be men around your age, give them a try.
if you act like that all the time, she might think you are desperate.
not everyone on here is in school.
tell him what you really want. that is what they tell me, but you have to do it and speak up.
should i make the first move or should i wait for him to make the first move?
what is the typical double standard you have set up?
after a while you do not even see the color.
i have not tried it yet, but i am still trying to get up the nerve.
if you two are serious, then asking her that question should not bother her.
inform her of what is up with that?
how about, would you like to go out with me sometime?
please look me up if you are ever in florida.
those were good times, i tell you.
it is all about her, and no, it should not be something that happens on a first date.
do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time?
if he comes to his senses, great, but do not screw him.
you are too good for them.
jump him because she likes him?
it depends on age, cds or dvds.
20 years down the road that is all you can be, so start from the beginning.
i would like to visit us. what are the needfull things?
anyone with any ideas, tips, or general information should contact me immediately.
you sound like a very nice person, so do not let some of these gals drag you down.
do not look, just go out and enjoy yourself and have fun and your boyfriend will come along.
do not persue it, he is getting married.
is it a clear liquid that turns yellow when dry?
i mean, if in your country there is an instant message system in your phone, then find a friend.
then when she starts closing her eyes, kiss her in the lipps, and then it is up to you.
please be honest with me, i can handle the truth.
have fun, and remember to never get so comfortable that you never know what will happen next.
it shows how much they care about you.
tell her that you miss her and that you love her.
coffee, lunch, sightseeing, walk/talk/play in the park, museum, and matinee.
if you believe that a woman is a hooker, you can find that in any corner of the world.
now we do all these things together and i do not know what to do.
because if it fails, you will be $h*t!
it has been the best thing for at least me.
try using some of these, but only if they actually apply.
the problem is that he cheated on me recently, and it was the worst thing he could have done.
if you are happy, she should be happy, unless he really is being bad to you.
we like it when men do things for us and think about us.
perhaps if you give him space, he will eventually call you back.
tell him you do not want a real relationship.
if you look creepy, and you do, they will all think you are leering.
i do not know about love, but he likes you for sure.
if a man truly respects you, then he will understand.
ask yourself and decide. and if you can afford it, do it if you want to.
because he is a superhero that is closest to being just a regular man.
sometimes the difficulties are worth it if the good outweighs the bad.
i do not think it is wise to date at work.
you need a theory class for that.
let it take it's course from there.
what do you think about gay marrige and relationshiops?
of course, i had to ask him if he was blowing me off.
men will think you are attractive, no matter what happens.
however, i do not believe that by not having sex with him, he will become unfaithful or leave you.
the safest rules of internet dating are these: 1. communicate via email and messenger.
marriage is really about trust and communication.
okay, so i had this problem as well.
it depends on what you kissed.
it depends on whether you could trust him before.
make sure you do not make her hate you to get your point across to her.
how long have you been meeting these filipinas?
what if it was just considered love?
that way, you are not exactly telling them what you specifically dislike about them.
if he is, then go for it.
then see if he is open for dinner and a movie.
i am sorry i do not know, and i wish the best of luck to both of you.
however, i find him looking at me every now and then.
this is sin, our own actions have started it.
fun includes eating breakfast (not breakfast if you know what i mean).
make a kind move if you do not know what to do.
let him make the first move. if you do, it may make you look like you are inebriated with him.
you people have no right to get married.
my tragic love story was that i loved him very much and he loved me as well.
you seem desperate, and you will never find a solution.
however, he swears that we are only friends.
looks don't really matter unless you are trying to prove something.
again, i know that if you have sex with him, he is no longer a good friend.
the fact that a man is so self-centered is a huge turn off for me.
do not rush it. feel all your emotions come alive.
it is a two way street until you get them, you will know which one it is.
so you have one child out of wedlock.
i know i am picky about people, but how can i stop it?
it hurts. jalot, perhaps some girls might say that is it?
i am going to jump that boy. is that the right choice?
so it was a good idee!
if she gets drunk, it is not a turn off.
because some women send men small messages without actually saying it clearly.
i would prefer if they left me alone.  sorry, i got off-topic.
ask her to go do something she is interested in or to see a movie she would like.
you are a man, a term used lightly.
however, it is too bad it is not automatic, like msn or aol.
that is how they will react to it, so it is a bad situation for you and him.
go back to that person at once before it is too late for you.
i also want to wipe that smile off her face.
ask if he wants to dance with you.
then she might say that it looks ugly, but i think that it (the color) looks better.
ask him to go see a doctor.
i never went out with him a second time.
first of all, why did you two break up?
why wait? go ahead and do it.
as long as he has an eloquent mind, who elses opinion matters?
i think i am still in love with him.
i have never wanted to have sex again.
the main thing is to not try to get back at the person who wronged you.
if you have to ask other people, i really do not think you are ready.
i am a gilr, and i say those things.
a great savings area is flowers.
time will tell. give it six months and see what happens.
either way, you are the only one who has a chance at getting some booty.
from your list, i would have to choose spiderman.
i was cheated on for three of the years.
all seniors think that freshman girls are easy, which is sad, but true.
if he says yes, then you can tell him.
impress her with affection and love.
and if you do, what was it like?
celebrate valentine with joy and fun, give each other gifts, and have a good time.
any women beside the ugly men will look attractive.
so, when i moved in, my neighbor asked me out.
you should probaly make a move because he is obviosly shy.
it is on a much harsher scale as time goes on.
ask yourself what is up and you might receive a response.
there are many times that you love the man, but are not sure that he loves you also.
if you are talking about your hubby or friends, i would say toys for his vehicle, sports related things.
that got me really hot, but i ran away.
me, i will pick up the tab if i can get your vote for the best answer.
k. what size of breast does the average man like, do you think?
many women are dating men, so the 22 yo men feel insecure and have to fish.
is it more like you just go out?
they probly know you can't really hide it, but you should tell your parents.
i will make you a princess on planet kripton.
my last girlfriend's boyfriend did that to her before we met, and she still kept him.
my friend has a boyfriend who she talks to online and on the phone.
do you prefer fake nails or manicured ones?
tell her that girls like to tell her the truth. good luck.
we can move around and be the best of friends.
stay true to your husband, after all, he is the one you said i wanted to marry.
do not listen to these fools with their b.s.
yes, i am a man, so i do not really have to pay.
remember, no bird has ever flown on one wing.
just let her know how you feel.
it depends, if you really love him, then i think you will want to egnolage it.
if you or the other person is married, run.
no, men do not, but little boys do.
help me win this debate with her.
my girlfriend is the nuttiest, but i love her anyway.
simple enough, do what everyone else does and play with it.
sweetheart, let him go. if he wants to be with you, he will return to you.
of course, after a day of that my back went out.
stay alive and get your old life back.
that is why i ask, "do you guys ever know what they want in any relationship?"
perhaps ask him out for lunch or a movie or something.
girls do not like someone who is all about themselves.
it depends on whether you like either one.
i was always looking, and i kept picking jerks.
so, no, i feel it is a choice and one does what feels comfortable to them.
some do, but others do not have it in them.
just do what makes you happy.
because for some reason i cannot.
so it would have to be love.
because, you know, try to find someone you love, but be considerate.
do not ask her to perform some act for you or give her the spotlight.
women are simply impressed if you show a little care, respect and honesty to them.
tell the bastard to get out.
they think it is the only correct way.
good luck and keep it cool.
he said you need to figure out yourself if you want to stay married to him.
and i hate him for it.
men like this will typically become wife beaters if you do not obey them.
first, i have four children, so being a homemaker is more work than my job.
no, i do not. i prefer normal-looking men.
it defenetely appears that he has feelings for you. do you show how you feel?
everything seems so open and click and run with most people these days.
i have a problem of unloading all my junk up front, and perhaps i told this guy too much.
the right date can save money on a lot of things.
if you truly love your man and want to work it out, then tell your x to respect that.
that only makes it easier to go to bed.
i do not think you should try it.
choose honesty and love and try to be true with them.
i was hoping for at least a 90%, but currently i think it is more like 70% or 65%.
but cuddling up with large women is one of the best feelings i know of.
women also expect men to behave like that, so why should they grow up?
a couple of ways:  get him drunk.
the problem is not whether you ask her while at work or not.
stick with 13 and 14 year old boys because they are easier to control anyway. good luck.
you should never let a man mistreat you.
i am not a stay at home romantic dinner type girl.
however, after i left him, i swore i would never get married again.
the lines are tacky. just be yourself and complament her. women like that.
you will be fine, just have fun.
not all the time, sometimes men shave them, it depends on the woman.
i love him, but i think i am ready to move on, meet new people.
so, wait for another four years.
i hope i see some of it soon.
i do not want to be mean.
also, you should wait a while for having children.
i would like to have some fun with you, which is why i answered that stupid question.
try to contact their Q&A team and they will help you through. have a nice day!
because women do not put out often.
if he does, it means he is only after sex.
a) it does not matter, anyone saying they do not is probably lying.
making love is like living a fantasy.
when you are 18 or 20, when they say something they do not mean it.
when possible, try to make it yourself.
there is always a but, isn't there?
if she is not interested in you anymore.
i seriously doubt that you are in love with that many men.
on average, i would say about 45% at first, but after you get to know the person, maybe 15%.
play sports with your friends.
she will tell you if it is not okay.
i do not mean, do you think women are sexy and beautiful?
how do i get him to stop nagging me and leave me alone?
a sex toy, that way you can both enjoy it.
men without hair look like little boys to me, and it is not sexy at all.
i agree, just kiss him and he will respond one way or another.
a good way is to imagine yourself without him/her.
here in america it is not so important.
well, if it was before you, then he was not cheating at all, obviously.
man, how many times have i passed up a great oppertunity by worrying about someone saying no?
because white women are taking up all the men.
your self image is also very important.
have you ever had a pap smear?
thank god. how old are you?
however, i believe they both like me.
okay, first, it sounds as if you are already married.
yes, jime is going to ask rubi out, but it is not your business.
that is a sign, things like that can make it really obvious.
you should take the time to get to know both of them equally without going out with them.
i would love to hear your opinions on this.
if you like the man, then go for it.
having fun with your friends is fine.
so it is natural with this man.
women take on a lot, and sometimes they feel like they do it for nothing.
no, because i am not married yet.
let me know what you think.
if you are homosexual, be homosexual.
good luck and hang in there.
i like older women, so i think it is wrong and wrong that they cannot go out with her.
i am curious to see what everyone thinks.
my last boyfriend i met was driving round a roundabout in another car.
because if you do, you will lose your friend over a man.
it really was a casual aside when i said it, i did not think he would remember.
are you a country girl or a city girl?
hang out all day together and to top it off, touch his feet.
i am very interested in being single. sittin back and watching other gurlz are all great fun!
women are curious about having sex with other women, even me!
i do not know what you said because i was too lazy to read your words.
i hate my appearance, i love the straight ones.
this is izzy, and i love and adore larger women.
there are not any words that will make it any better.
do it before it is too late.
it is possible to tell the truth when you learn, but you have to actually do it.
nay pier is a great place or one of the museums, and there are a lot of great resturaunts in hotels.
that is a stereotype. i am not a country girl, by the way, and i think i am sexy in my own way.
he will not turn you down.
i hope you read this very well.
a lot of men like strong women, but most of them are black.
if she is interested, she will call later.
no, you will not because you know he has cheating tendancies.
ask your self that, if you know what i mean.
i find that if i try hard, i can see things that i know are not there normally.
have coffee and chat and take it from there.
just move on with your life and enjoy some eles!
i would bet your not, but try email me atilikethickchix@yahoo.com and i will be honest.
me and this boy have been dating off and on since last year.
i really care about you, and i cannot stop thinking about you.
it is worth the wait when you are ready.
if you do not know, ask someone who does.
keep away from your fear and tell him.
there is a chance you will have to take.
so, if you want to be attractive to losers, creeps, and perverts, drink up!
not for anything other than to look.
after all, while i am alive, and i still love him.
it is your own life, as you said.
now that i am in devorce, i am stuck with it.
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend does not mean he is.
please let me know more 'bout you.
when one minute you want to throttle the other person and the next you want to jump their bones.
the girlz that are attractive or have a great personality.
ppl whose parents well take care of them are a big time lazy ppl.
i do not know what she wants.
if you are very inculcated, say it again, but in a simple way.
show her what you are good at.
if you can imagine him as the father of your children.
if you do not ask sombody, someone else might.
that is why i am single.
if you truly love him, you would let him go.
if she does not want to be with you, try to be her friend.
well, if he says he does not believe him.
let's get it out of limbo.
i even worked there for a while and met the man of my dreams.
i have been with my husband for four years, and we recently got married in december of 2005.
focus on how things are and what would be best for you right now.
you will see that no matter how hurt you are, it is still the simplest reason you smile.
wow, i did not think pakistan is that conservative.
i have to stop immediately because i am ready to relieve myself.
whatever you do, do not tell him too soon.
we can't know if she really means it.
i do not like a man who does that all the time.
then you can make an easier decision.
i have slept with many girls and some are whores.
he dribbles, he shoots, and he scores two points.
talk to your best friend and see if that is okay.
is this a trick question?
i do not know. can i do anything about it?
people are husbands and wives for many reasons.
if he does not, there are too many fish in the sea.
do you want to say that?
if you are not happy, fix it or get out.
not all men, but some men do.
i completely agree with udaman. good luck.
it sounds like you like to sell yourself too much.
your girlfriend will just think you're a jerk.
sometimes, you have to observe the one you call your husband.
replaying everything you have ever done to me?
do not just sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
i dated a guy this past year, and he got to a violent point.
leave it alone. i do not care what she says, she is in enough pain.
how would anyone know if they do not know anything about you?
just find someone who loves you.
it never hurts to be flirty.
we were hanging out for a while.
do not use pick up lines, that is a turn off.
i love them b/c i am a man and i do not have to ask anyone to the dance.
do you think there are more men out there who love thick girls than you think?
the girls that complain that flowers do not last are simply ungrateful.
you need to be attracted to that person, you have found your true love.
and i mean to be her friend.
how do i get my sweetheart to show me he loves me?
basically, you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking about him.
they have never met, but she says they are in love.
do not do this over the phone, email, etc.
i am not against gayz and lez, they are the best friends a person can have.
i have a girlfriend, and i want to know how to know if she is into me or not.
death is like a box full of candy corn.
just try to make the best of what is to come.
either you move on with your life or you try to make it work with this person.
she is the love of my life, and i cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with her.
because women think with their brains.
i am still in love with my ex, and i am mad at my cousin because my ex likes her.
only time will tell. spend time with friends have fun, do not thimk sbout it.
that is why i do not get in chat rooms anymore, unless it is to laugh at all the freaks.
yes, that is what i did, a big mistake on my part.
i have no idea where to begin.
but he is unfaithful, so i think i can lift or carry my husband.
if she is calling just to bablle, tell her to not call you so often.
that is all i have to say.
you should not be asking that question.
i was also thinking of lime green.
i mean the both of you together.
i have a close friend.
wanting to be something they are not?
well, if you can imagine your self with him in bed at night.
they like the challange, and that is what i love about it.
it depends on the girl, i think. fair skinned females look extra pale when they have black hair.
man, i should do that when i date next time.
do not listen to what anyone else tells you to do.
i really like this guy, and i don't know if it is just a crush or if i love him.
i think the bomb is much easier.
not always the easiest, but they have been good years.
do not forget to choose and vote for the best answer.
do not tell her why you like her.
did you turn gay, or is it a curiosity?
no, not if you have to ask.
the list could go on and on.
perhaps he will enjoy all the waiting, dreaming, and teasing.
do not eat where you take a s***.
of course, if you do want to chat, contact me at fla_cat_blue@yahoo.com.
when he teases you about the stupid little things.
if you think that he feels the same way about you, why not?
well, in my experience, a lot of the time one of them ends up cheating on the other.
they are often worse than men.
i have heard of friends getting married six months after meeting someone.
i do not know what you mean.
if you want children, then be a homemaker.
what is the worst that could happen?
intellect, a woman with brains is simply attractive.
his/her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, their good looks and activeness.
yes, and will you pay mine as well?
that is all i can say, but yes, i have long black hair and i am proud.
i was not going to let her win.
chances are, if you like her as a friend, you will like her more.
just be yourself when you are with her.
men think that they are special and that they are only good enough for certain girls.
find someone you like and say that you will be my valentine.
post more questions on yahoo answers.
well, if the one boy picks on you, why do you like him?
on the other hand, if he is a man, at least you will be happy.
size, shape, appearance, etc. should not matter at all.
sex is not the only thing important in life.
you are probably just too good for him anyway.
do you like him or do you not like him?
why do you not just ask her if you can kiss her?
who would say that country girls are more attractive?
i do not know how old you are, which would help.
just think about what you like and do it back for them. it's like a tounge massage.
here is my answer: a) most men definitely do not prefer girls that are skin and bone.
cut your cousin and your ex boyfriend off complete.
or does his friends point at you when you are with him?
yes, it is possible to enjoy pleasure rather than recieving it.
now i am thinking of getting it on with a girl.
it depends on whether they are brunette or not.
is she simply trying to use you?
you can have a big "no-no" and then suck in bed.
get rid of the x if you are dating the man you love right now.
it hurt like hell and i bled.
cuddling, kissing, fondling, playing with each other's sexual organs before intercourse.
when he does, explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and want him back.
my boyfriend loves me to death and does not want to give me up.
you are already doing it, so why bother?
on the hood of my car at the waterfront in a light rain, it was awesome!
i think you are probaly a nice guy and she probaly loves you.
you are looking hard, or perhaps you are looking in the wrong places. sign up for yahoo personals.
only if you want it to be.
but if she does not have a reason, then she is not your friend.
you have to find what is right for you and your partner.
you are definitely not a hoe, do not worry.
women do not think it is cool, they think that men who smoke are pathetic because they are killing themselves.
do you like asian food?
they do not mean to get them pregnant, they simply can not keep it in their pants because they are pigs.
i like natural and real girls, but i do not like fake, prissy drama queens.
it depends on how the world works and their desire to catch up.
that is too many, and selfish.indeed, you are just desperate to keep trying another one, right?
it is like if you decide to eat chocalate and then moan because you look too fat.
do you know he loves you?
my wife forgives me for a lot of things.
first, you order one online and the stork brings one to you.
i would say around three or four.
imagine that i am that guy and be my girl freind!
give them a chance to discover you.
it is unusal, but nothing bad.
i still love him and know what to do.
do not just stay with him for the baby.
never ignore her, always listen to her, and when you do, do not change the subjet. women hate that.
it can be good luck also if you take it as good luck.
it is a man thing, live with it.
it sounds like you are going through a lot right now.
good luck and do your homework.
do not come here. it smells like a trap to me.
everywhere, just ask any girl passing by, but only in thailand, not in us.
this woman does not want a bad boy at all.
however, i need to be happy.
you are so full of it, teasing all these desperate sad men, shame on you.
also, sometimes men think they do not need you so much until you are gone.
all that i can say is good luck.
you married your hubby because you love him.
i love to express my feelings to the ladies with poems. has anyone written one for a special person?
why tie yourself to only one man?
that is if you both agreed on doing it.
it is like saying, "what is going to stop me when i have already done it?"
he simply has to start over and earn your trust again.
on his side of his family, i met his father.
when we fall in love, they treat us badly. why are we there?
i am one of those who want to wait until they are completely in love with someone.
try the nice way first. girls hate being ignored.
keeping secrets will hurt the ones you love.
some women like large hairy men, some men like fat women, some gals like skinny men, and vice-versa.
curves, especially if they have large breasts and softness, can not be considered a soft woman.
never tell her that he is a big one.
if you are a mother, act like one.
i think due to society, i say screw society and give me a hard time.
give them two months and they will get over you.
i do not know, but daniel k has never read manga.
i think it is kind of nice, it is like your father's blessing all the way.
i like intelligent, fun and attractive women.
come to my town and be your girlfriend.
this generation is simply too stupid.
yes, it is time to cash in your chips.
they are always in the "in love" stage.
i see a malaysia air ad on tv and i go gaga.
it was really nice when he asked me out.
try talking to her and ask her to hang out as friends to see if it goes well.
this is really difficult because there are a lot of temptations out there.
not what you can become just because she says it.
the two of you should speak privately and personally. you need to understand each other's side. do it now.
well, the one i liked goes something like this.
do not try to have sex.
just keep it cool. it may be a little hard to get. it might help.
should your relationship survive the four seasons, i think you should be ready.
i married my boyfriend, and do you know why (besides love).
move on and find someone who does not hate you.
you can not, so let's start asumming it.
yes, we like flowers, beautiful, good smelling ones.
should i or shouldn't i? younger man vs older woman.
okay, the other replies are just cocky, but i am way more comfortable.
lime green would be more appropriate for a summer wedding.
if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry.
my boyfriend snores and i have the most terrible time sleeping.
may you think not, but yes.
we have no room for messed up animals such as this in our society.
the best and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married there.
his answer is good enough for me.
no single man can give you what you really want.
if he does not start acting right, then leave him.
if you like hottie, show him your boobies.
a lot of men do that, just looking for sex.
i mess up a lot at times, but she does not forget.
wait for him to ask you out unless you are truly desirous.
you are asking, do you like me?
whatever you decide, make it completly yours.
her parents? you can't fix it. her friends? maybe you can talk to them nicely.
how drunk is this girl?
gals luv men with positive self image.
i am doing this just for the points.
if you don't know anything about each other, you can't connect.
if you do, then i would say it was a real and worth realtionship.
however, if you are used to it and you actually like it, go with it.
because it is buy one, take one.
and last, but certainly not least, does he always happen to be staring?
it sounds like a con, but i am telling you, chicks love it.
you just have met the dumb ones out there who think skinny is better.
however, i have always believed in the fact that there is a huge difference between having sex and making love.
you simply have to make yourself walk away.
in my case, i think 80 percent.
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss on the forehead.
i cannot see my life without my husband.
i do, much prettier and as smooth as silk.
however, flowers are really nice, even if they do not last.
it sounds as if he is having too much fun while you are away.
why don't you just leave the girl alone?
perhaps you should try dating girls if they offend you.
i also have not a single female friend.
just remeber,
they feel that they are better than womans, but they are wrong.
that does not mean you should let them in.
it is always in the back of my mind.
does she have other friends to gossip with on the fone?
getting married and having a child can wait, but studies can not.
however, you need to do this a few times.
most teen boys prefer girls that like sex.
do not look back and enjoy the friends you have.
what is good or bad is your personal opinion on something.
i do not know what i should do.
yes, it is a bad habit.
wait until you are twenty-five, you will not lose your charm by then.
my boyfriend hates my boyfriend and wishes for me to break up with him, but i will not.
relax and be yourself, that is what we enjoy.
i do not think so. perhaps they should try taking our last names.
you both should choose either his or yours once you have children.
of course, he wants to continue.
so, i suppose i choose domestic goddess.
ask her out after class again.
a person's life is to live it to the fullest and have faith.
i am a man, and i also feel that way because i am.
if you like him that much, call him.
start with a basic everyday question and go from there.
tell more ppl (my bor did)
all my friends want to do is make out.
include actual kissing and asking if you are a good kisser.
we will not regret it at your service.
you need to reputate it and add it back the same way the first time.
you can share this with your mom or dad.
do not fall for the alcoholic only on the basis that the man above is giving.
you have sort of stuck yourself out. you are not likely to get hurt unless you know him fairly well.
i prefer a & b cups, myself.
be her friend first and see where it goes.
do not even listen to what other people say, just watch how they act.
do you feel that way?
however, if a man asks you, do not be afraid to say no.
obviously, she does not want you if you know she likes the other boy.
there are many things that make a woman not like sex.
not all men get bored and move on.
however, there is no better person to marry than your best friend.
depending on what you are looking for, freindship only.
i did it with my current boyfriend.
that does not mean you cannot love one another.
just divorce that man. he has no honor and he does not love you.
cicaly men simply want to have a girlfriend for free sex.
if it does not work, you will have to ask him again.
it is personal, so keep to it. whether a man goes out with you should not determine how you act.
you have to search yourself for this one.
if the man is worthy enough, you will not need to.
i am confused. i hate a girl to be like that. what should i do?
shop around for invitations and everything else.
he then asked me, "can i come with you?"
just go with your feelings. if you like her so much, then go with it.
so, i find myself around men i do not like, and you know the outcome.
i hope you find a nice girl.
yes, i have liked this girl since i was in ninth grade.
to my fellow girls at the cone, a big hello and a hug!
if shae like him, then there is a connection.
if going to a movie is special for the two of you, then do it.
it just sounds as if you wear the pants.
have you told her that it is kind of annoying that she has to check up on you everyday?
for the same reason, thin girls prefer slender, toned men.
he handed me his cell phone and asked me to put in my phone number.
go to hawaii, ha ha, or pay someone.
i do not understand why people think it is wrong.
keep searching for a believer in romance, she is out there!
if you plan on cheating on your wife, you are a pig and need to be shot.
look, he already knows that you like him, and has he said anything bad about it?
confront him and ask him that way you will know.
it is more of a trust issue i would say.
never stop trying to impress her.
no, you are punished, and you have no television for a month.
i think this is better than the one on top of me.
however, that did not bother me, because as i said, i and #92;e were just friends.
go to school, you can still come home or call your family and friends.
please, go with the one that picks on you because nine times out of ten, he likes you.
i always felt the same way, until i met my true love and my views changed.
take a bath. do you know how to speak?
i like him and he says things like, "if i weren't dating, i would go out with you?"
just get rid of him, you will be better off.
this is the only time in your life to truly live out the true fantasy of love.
people have asked me, "what is the hurry?
has he just dumped a girl and left before?
suffice to say, i am 36 years old and still in therapy around it.
for God's sake, do not be one of those controling baby mamas.
did you ever think of that?
it has been half a year, is it normal that you still like him?
look for a man who is attractive.
it is very sweet and just what you are looking for.
is there a reason that you are not related to the child's father?
no! no! it certainly is most uncool. you are simply wasting your health because girls just hate it.
anything larger than a handful is a waste, probably a size c or d.
i myself believe that they do.
stop trying to slap it in everyones face.
you should probably be looking for a public place where you are most comfortable.
a man asks me, "do you mind if we cuddle?"
should you ask about the outcome of the last game?
because some couples never get to that comfortable stage.
i always say that you shouldn't do things if you will regret them later.
even the day after would be okay.
all you are missing is a million dollar smile.
when i hear you, the same thing happened to me.
altho, i do not really like girls all that much.
be really nice and make eye contact and smile a lot. i hope this helps.
i would wonder why he shaved them, but in the end, they are his legs.
best of luck to you both.
this is what i have experienced many times.
i will go with anything more natural than fake. i even hate the word fake.
ten years younger, who wants an older woman?
ask your best friend if it would be okay.
many people will tell you no.
downtown houston is available on any weekend with a lot of clubs.
who said women do not feel anything?
do not start with her looks, mister.
if they have moved on, then you should too.
flirt and see how he reponds.
i am waiting until i am married, but when is it too far?
without her takin your number, there is nothing wrong with that.
you do not have to be an overly happy, hyperactive person.
i do not want to just randomly go up there and be able to go out with someone else?
then comes the fun part, he makes it up to you.
you should give at least five minutes for kissing and huging and there may be some licking also.
i cannot help any more unless i have more infor.
because i say no on avatars.
some girls prefer gifts that will not die on them, something that lasts.
he is probably wondering if you are interested in him at all. flirt back.
i feel silly, dorky, and happy.
if you are a hoe, then he is one. i personally do not think you are one.
there are some men that only say the "l" word if they mean it.
i do not need a trophy girl, i want a companion.
as a man, let me say that.
be confident, and always believe in yourself. do not be arrogant, and always make eye contact and listen to what she has to say.
then he said do you want some of my chapstick?
there is no wrong or right way to kiss anyone.
because we love them, it is not until later when we think about it that we realize what we have done.
i would not know if i have the same issue.
what was the mistake you made?
it is like breaking a drug habit.
tell him, and it would not seem psycho because you have known each other for a long time.
yes, for the first answer, the girl answered for me.
or, what about blue and green?
a life of your own, a life you have been missing out on.
confusing. yes, i think you are correct.
the thing is, you do not have to ask her out to go out with her.
perhaps he will call you.
yes, tell her, but be as polite as possible.
in a park when i was 16, i lost my virgenate.
a man does not like large breasts.
you should be proud of yourself.
yes, men work and fix things, but what else can you do?
we do not know what you look like.
if you could have four qualities in your woman, what would they be?
look on the internet and you will find a lot of things for the wedding or your local newspaper.
if she sits on your best friend's lap because she is drunk, then yes, it is a turn off.
see my boyfriend (go to my 360).
you will find a man who truly deserves you one day.
well, you, and that sexy perfume you wear.
if he isn't and you are still not ready, then screw him.
why do they want it state sanctioned?
she still lets me play with my trucks and watch cartoons.
move on, but you can still luv him.
see if he is willing to go out of his way for you.
if anyone knows, let me know.
i never knew life could be so good.
he said that he would call me back.
choose the one you enjoy the most.
take it off the pop up block.
if you truly love him, you will tell him.
who knows, but i would absolutly love for it to be done for me.
what should i do to get her?
man, you have to suck it up and introduce yourself.
there are movies that i have not seen yet.
i think it all depends on age, upbringing, and upbringing.
and that will be just s*x!
my boyfriend was definitely my friend first, and it is total bliss!
who gives a fuck what anyone else thinks.
also try getting some blonde highlights.
just let it go, i use art a lot to discuss the problems that i have.
if she likes music, make a special cd or tape.
it could be that you choose one and why?
do not worry about what people will say.
i think a lot of girls like flowers.
i cannot explain it, and no, it has nothing to do with them looking young, vulnerable or submissive.
let him go, either that or date his brother.
yes, there are, you just have to look.
you can get them in staples for $35.
your child will have a difficult time growing up without a father.
my friend says that i am nice and i should tell them no.
my girlfriend always says that she loves me when we are passing notes during class, but she does not say it confrontationally.
that is correct, the right relationship happened on it's own.
you will look like an idiot.
no, you should not care. if you like him, then stay with him.
i thnk that you have a strong sense of self, high self esteem, and self confidence.
anything that is not nailed down.
make it your top priority to see her if you really want to be with her that badly.
one of my best friends had a fight with my big sister a few months ago.
should i simply forget about it and move on?
there are friends, on the other hand, it is a different story.
yes, what do i think anyone does?
my cuzin met up with some wierd old perv saying that he was a hot teen that she met online.
none of them are in my list, so i choose my neighbors wife.
i have long black hair and i love it. my husband loves it too.
you care about your family, and everyone in your family will love you.
ugly (or fat) men simply take what they can get.
in the middle of the river while there were ppl watching, it was actually quite beautiful.
it is all in the eye contact.
it depends on the man, some men do and some do not.
it kind of gives us the idea that you may not have strong guts.
i think if you love him and he really loves you, he may want to disapoint his father.
yes, some men get right down to it with absolutly no regard for the woman.
perhaps she is not a beeeatch and the skinny chick is.
it does sound a little girlie.
if you want to relax a bit, why not check out some restaurants, night clubs, gyms, etc?
there are plenty of good women left, you just have to look in the right place.
hey, it's like, everyone is going to seperate one day or the other.
you win some, you lose others. take it with a grain of salt and be more considerate next time.
happy birthday to you.
i just need someone to help me figure this out.
choose the 1 w/ better treatment towards you.
i am into a 6th grade boy.
if you end it, he may not be your friend, which is why i do not go with friends.
put yourself out there more often. you have to do more than eye contact.
do what is best for you and him.
bad teeth, bad breath, and bad breasts.
no one needs to know that.
if i am to ask, i will then leave, end the relationship, and move on with my life.
hey, do not get me wrong.
i asked him if he still liked me and he said yes, but he did not act like it.
where am i going with this?
keep getting younger and younger men as one gets older and get a new one for her.
you know that if you did not play the guilt trip.
that does not mean that it makes it right, it means that it makes us human.
it is a mistake that cannot be undone.
practice unwrapping a starburst with your tongue and twirling cherry stems with your tongue.
do you catch her looking at you?
i know three men that i can probably get away with doing something like that.
ask her out or tell her you like or admire her.
if he is going to be an on and off guy like that, i suggest you dump him.
if they do, then you will have to move on with your life.
i have never been to it.
compliment her, ask her name, do not act weird, act like you are the smoothest guy ever.
she calls him all the time.
how should i approach her and be not just another guy hitting on her?
wait a little while, then date men, that way you enjoy it more.
someone who is never "bitchy" just because she thinks it is cool, it is not.
b/c you do not have any decision about what to do.
i know, but why should i hide it?
some men simply do not like to dance.
if she is not your friend, b-cuzz she will not stop bugging you.
i wish i had listened to my friends.
after how much time do you conclude that it takes too long and she is not really interested?
do i want to be in love?
why do they want to be married?
no brainer. there is a nice picture of george clooney on your profile.
a woman cannot seem to find men her own age attractive.
some do, but i would rather have a pair that were not too large.
it sounds as if you are both comfortable with things being the way they are.
it is very sexy, and it will look very nice on most women.
sometimes it is better to be very good friends first and make sure you are happy around each other.
anyway, my question is, will i always feel that way?
listen to faith. love is not like that.
please, do not ask that question if you do not want your feelings hurt.
the boyfriend should accept that if he loves you.
i think it is very attractive when a man shaves his legs.
if you guys still keep in touch, i do not think that is the best thing to do.
i like this boy austin, and i told my friend claudia to ask him if he likes me.
you are ruining the romance by asking that stupid question. have you ever thought of having fun together?
he is a player, so do not trust me.
it depends on whether they all like different things, but not self-enterd freaks like you.
i think that is great. perhaps you should make the first move.
if he turns you down, he is not worth it in the first place.
you should go up to her.
it is a good idea to always be honest, because not many men i know do not like being told they are attractive.
they know the women will not pursue them like good looking or wealthy men who get tons of chicks.
just face him and say, "hey, do you want to see a movie?"
that is why they call it making love.
smile to him once in a while, and then he will know.
most women are polite and will answer.
i would say that you sound like my best friend.
say hello (whatever his name is) when you take me to dinner?
it really depends on the man, but i think most men seriously do not care.
if you want it to work out, it will.
if he does not want to dance, then give it up.
but you know what, i feel the man should make the first move.
without a boyfriend, it would be a bit slutty.
take it from a military girl.
you never know. they never show efection only when they want it.
i am 49 years of age and looking for a beautiful woman to spend my time with.
do you think they seem more attractive?
go to deleted items and it should be there.
this is a red flag of how he is. i wonder!
it may be because your name is freakgirl, but if you show your face, there are no hard feelings.
that would be so painful, you know. have you been there?
do you love her in depth?
have fun in jail by asking that question to your cell mate.
nah, the only time you see a man emotional is when he is with his girlfriend.
yes, i have done it, it was a lot of fun.
you should let the person you are with know what you want.
of course, if she calls five times a day about it, then it would be insane.
hang in there for one that excites you.
my mother reads them all of the time. email: info@alanatvl.com
besides, do you think he has enough to worry about?
i have been dating this guy who is younger than me.
men play at love to get love, women play at love to get love.
it has to be played out after a while.
everyone likes to be told that they are attractive, even if they do not admit it.
yes, but it is the opposite of the man.
mabey because i just think they look sexy when they are running on the feild.
you are too young to be talking about kissing.
i will tell her soon, because she is my best friend, and any help would be great.
i agree with the other preson before anyone gets hurt.
i am ready to move on, but i love him way too much.
go out and do everything you couldn't when you were with him/her.
obviously, men are not much better.
what if you tell him that you just want to be friends with benefits?
play the truth or dare game together.
he sounds like a manipulative jerk.
slow down the pace, slow down the play.
death is like a large black bag full of crack or crack or meth.
practice kissing me. where do you live?
no, you do not. i was married to a complete arsehole.
it sounds as if you really love her. you do not need to forget her.
tell him that you are wannabe friends and that you are relly disappointed that he would act so dumb.
he always finds a way to get out in the open, just don't do it.
and yuck, what is with chest hair?
for now, i think he is angry, hurt, upset, and has gotten over you.
give your brother some money and tell him to take a walk.
no offense, but it sounds like a girls name you know, no disrespect intended.
be cool and ask her on a date.
after you take her out, get to know her, and then go for the kill. ask her out.
people do not like to be played yo-yo with.
practice to unwrap starburst wrappers with your tounge, the girls love it.
i do not know. i just want the points.
that is not exactly true, it is just that most girls are discreet about it.
it depends. are you a hottie with a body?
i told him it was too late, but other than that, i wouldn't have minded getting flowers sometimes.
believe in is a strange way to put it.
why can't men (or women in your case) ever say the word "love"?
just enjoy the age you are and do not worry about all of this.
even though i am 19, do i like anything up to thirty?
i have a friend in the same situation.
girls are just as perverted, trust me.
you should not go out with a man because you 'need' to.
man, what you are saying is that she does not want to be anything other than a boyfriend and girlfriend?
is it usually about a year before both people begin to feel comfortable in that uncomfortable,boring, stage?
probably because i knew that all my girlfriends were not really the one until i met my wife.
i think as long as you do not base your relationship on sex, it is okay.
some men would do that.  why?
if your the average male, size shouldn't matter.
stay far away from men who can not say i like you.
please ask for permission by all means, and watch how quickly she pulls the s--- out of you.
honey, my husband likes me for me.
my mother also has cancer, and this just hits close to home for me.
then be your best self. if he is impressed or likes you, he will talk back.
you do not want anyone else but that person.
why don't you try chatting with other men to see his reaction?
however, it is okay to kiss on the first date.
men have a problem with secrets.
i had someone get angry with me because i was still dating?
how do i just kiss him?
i am the maid of honor for my only sister, and i want it to be perfect.
unless it is with the wrong man.
